1
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:42,141
當我躺在退伍軍人醫院的時候
When I was lying there in the VA hospital,

2
00:00:42,277 --> 00:00:45,147
人生猶如進入了空虛的大洞
with a big hole blown through the middle of my life,

3
00:00:45,988 --> 00:00:48,443
我開始作起了飛行的夢
I started having these dreams of flying.

4
00:00:49,867 --> 00:00:51,277
自由自在
I was free.

5
00:00:54,538 --> 00:00:58,120
但你早晚會醒來
Sooner or later, though, you always have to wake up.

6
00:01:14,515 --> 00:01:16,424
在冷凍期，你沒有夢
In cryo, you don't dream at all.

7
00:01:17,393 --> 00:01:19,468
感覺不像過了6年
It doesn't feel like six years.

8
00:01:19,603 --> 00:01:21,974
更像是喝醉酒，跟人幹了一架
More like a fifth of tequila and an ass-kicking.

9
00:01:28,528 --> 00:01:30,354
湯米才是科學家，不是我
Tommy was the scientist, not me.

10
00:01:31,198 --> 00:01:33,653
他才是那個 願意在數光年外找死
He was the one who wanted to get shot light-years out in space

11
00:01:33,783 --> 00:01:35,027
只為找到真相的傢伙
to find the answers.

12
00:01:35,702 --> 00:01:37,528
我們到了沒？
Are we there yet?

13
00:01:37,662 --> 00:01:39,405
是的，我們到了
Yeah, we're there, sunshine.

14
00:01:40,122 --> 00:01:41,532
我們到了
We're there.

15
00:01:41,665 --> 00:01:43,075
是關於你哥哥的
It's about your brother.

16
00:01:46,878 --> 00:01:49,547
那是在湯米 準備出航的一週前
So, a week before Tommy's gonna ship out,

17
00:01:49,673 --> 00:01:53,337
有人給了他一槍 為搶他皮夾裡的鈔票
a guy with a gun ends his journey for the paper in his wallet.

18
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:58,502
你們在冷凍艙待了 五年零九個月又22天
You've been in cryo for five years, nine months and 22 days.

19
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,510
你們會感到飢餓和乏力
You will be hungry. You will be weak.

20
00:02:01,643 --> 00:02:04,180
如果感到噁心，請用身邊的袋子…
If you feel nausea, please use the sacks...

21
00:02:04,312 --> 00:02:06,268
是的，湯米才是科學家
Yeah, Tommy was the scientist.

22
00:02:06,397 --> 00:02:09,563
而我，只是一個願意 替他去送死的傻瓜
Me, I'm just another dumb grunt going someplace he's gonna regret.

23
00:02:23,413 --> 00:02:25,452
前方就是潘朵拉星球
Up ahead was Pandora.

24
00:02:26,916 --> 00:02:30,829
小時候就聽說過 沒想到有一天自己會去
You grew up hearing about it, but I never figured I'd be going there.

25
00:02:40,929 --> 00:02:44,262
你兄弟參與了一項很重要的投資
Your brother represented a significant investment.

26
00:02:44,391 --> 00:02:47,177
我們想要你繼續他的合同
We'd like to talk to you about taking over his contract.

27
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:51,805
因為你們的基因相同 只有你才辦得到
And since your genome is identical to his, you could step into his shoes,

28
00:02:53,358 --> 00:02:54,733
就像這樣
so to speak.

29
00:03:01,115 --> 00:03:03,688
會是個在新世界的新開始
It'd be a fresh start on a new world.

30
00:03:11,624 --> 00:03:13,034
而且報酬也很不錯
And the pay is good.

31
00:03:14,253 --> 00:03:15,628
非常不錯
Very good.

32
00:03:37,565 --> 00:03:40,933
- 戴上面具！戴上面具！ - 戴上面具！準備出發！
- Exo-packs on! Let's go! Exo-packs on! - Exo-packs on! Let's go!

33
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:42,350
大家記好了，一但失去面具…
Remember, people, you lose that mask,

34
00:03:42,487 --> 00:03:46,104
20秒內你就會昏迷 4分鐘內你就會死去
you're unconscious in 20 seconds, you're dead in four minutes!

35
00:03:46,241 --> 00:03:49,526
今天最好別死！ 會讓我的飛行記錄很難看
Let's nobody be dead today! Looks very bad on my report.

36
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:53,996
地獄門塔樓 TAV 1-6號正在靠近
Hell's Gate tower, this is TAV 1-6 on approach.

37
00:03:54,123 --> 00:03:55,866
穿越外部標記，礦場就在眼前
Crossing outer marker. Mine is in sight.

38
00:04:34,036 --> 00:04:35,411
一個生命結束
One life ends,

39
00:04:36,121 --> 00:04:37,615
另一個就會開始
another begins.

40
00:04:45,087 --> 00:04:47,375
摘下護帶！取好行李！
Harnesses off! Get your packs!

41
00:04:47,506 --> 00:04:50,921
- 放在一起，準備出發 - 取下安全帶，一分鐘
- Put it together, let's go! Let's go! - Harnesses off! One minute!

42
00:04:51,051 --> 00:04:55,000
通道降下後直接進入基地 別停留！
When that ramp comes down, go directly into the base. Do not stop!

43
00:04:55,138 --> 00:04:57,675
直接進去，等我的指令
Go straight inside. Wait for my mark!

44
00:05:04,147 --> 00:05:08,014
走，走，走！出發！ 開走！
Go, go, go, go! Get out of there! Keep moving! Let's go, let's go!

45
00:05:12,905 --> 00:05:14,897
根本沒有「前軍人」這說法
There's no such thing as an ex-Marine.

46
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:18,950
你可以退伍 但是決不會失去軍魂
You may be out, but you never lose the attitude.

47
00:05:20,495 --> 00:05:23,068
我告訴自己 別人能做到的，我也能
I told myself I could pass any test a man could pass.

48
00:05:28,045 --> 00:05:30,915
只要你有錢，能治好殘疾
They can fix a spinal, if you got the money,

49
00:05:31,047 --> 00:05:33,716
但在這個環境下 只靠退伍金可負擔不起
but not on vet benefits, not in this economy.

50
00:05:35,677 --> 00:05:38,547
走吧，特殊個案 別讓我等你！
Let's go, special case! Do not make me wait for you!

51
00:05:38,679 --> 00:05:40,338
好啊，小姐們
Well, well, ladies.

52
00:05:41,974 --> 00:05:43,633
看看這些菜鳥！
Look at all this fresh meat!

53
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:53,561
在地球上 他們是保家衛國的軍人
Back on Earth, these guys were Army dogs, Marines,

54
00:05:53,694 --> 00:05:55,152
為自由而戰
fighting for freedom.

55
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:03,404
當心，老爺車
Look out, hot rod!

56
00:06:04,829 --> 00:06:06,738
但是在外面 他們只是僱傭兵
But out here they're just hired guns,

57
00:06:06,872 --> 00:06:09,658
拿人錢財 替企業賣命
taking the money, working for the company.

58
00:06:09,792 --> 00:06:11,120
看這個
Check this out, man.

59
00:06:11,793 --> 00:06:13,251
輪子上一堆肉
Meals on wheels.

60
00:06:14,589 --> 00:06:17,459
夥計，這不行吧
Oh, man, that is just wrong.

61
00:06:18,259 --> 00:06:19,373
我這有兩個人有空！
I got two guys free in about 20 minutes!

62
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:21,004
收到！需要幫手！
Got it! Need them!

63
00:06:30,436 --> 00:06:32,558
這裡不再是堪薩斯州
You're not in Kansas anymore.

64
00:06:35,024 --> 00:06:38,891
你們處於潘朵拉，大夥們
You are on Pandora, ladies and gentlemen.

65
00:06:39,028 --> 00:06:42,728
珍惜自己的每分每秒
Respect that fact every second of every day.

66
00:06:45,034 --> 00:06:46,611
如果有地獄
If there is a hell,

67
00:06:47,411 --> 00:06:51,989
待過潘朵拉以後 你寧願去地獄度假
you might want to go there for some R&R after a tour on Pandora.

68
00:06:52,874 --> 00:06:54,996
在圍牆外面{\r}
Out there, beyond that fence,

69
00:06:55,126 --> 00:06:59,419
每個生物 帶爪的，會飛的，泥潭的
every living thing that crawls, flies or squats in the mud

70
00:06:59,547 --> 00:07:02,666
都想殺死你 把你的眼睛當菜吃
wants to kill you and eat your eyes for Jujubes.

71
00:07:04,594 --> 00:07:09,338
這裡的土著居民叫納美人
We have an indigenous population of humanoids called the Na'vi.

72
00:07:09,473 --> 00:07:11,761
他們有帶毒的弓箭
They're fond of arrows dipped in a neurotoxin

73
00:07:11,892 --> 00:07:14,643
一分鐘就能要你的命
that'll stop your heart in one minute.

74
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:19,063
他們的骨骼 有天然碳纖維加固
And they have bones reinforced with naturally occurring carbon fiber.

75
00:07:19,733 --> 00:07:21,524
很難殺死他們
They are very hard to kill.

76
00:07:23,027 --> 00:07:26,976
作為安全主管 我要保障你們生命
As head of security, it is my job to keep you alive.

77
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:30,692
我做不到
I will not succeed.

78
00:07:32,912 --> 00:07:34,287
如果沒有你們大家配合
Not with all of you.

79
00:07:35,414 --> 00:07:37,406
如果想生還
If you wish to survive,

80
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:40,375
你們必須培養堅強意志
you need to cultivate a strong mental attitude.

81
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:43,369
必須遵守規定
You've got to obey the rules.

82
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:46,170
潘朵拉的規定
Pandora rules.

83
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,126
第一條…
Rule number one...

84
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,884
這像極了當年軍校的 宣講教條
There's nothing like an old-school safety brief

85
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:52,671
讓人倍感懷念
to put your mind at ease.

86
00:07:55,057 --> 00:08:00,560
打擾一下，傑克！ 你是傑克吧，湯姆的兄弟
Excuse me. Excuse me. Jake! You're Jake, right? Tom's brother.

87
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:03,478
你倆長得真像
Wow! You look just like him.

88
00:08:03,607 --> 00:08:07,307
抱歉，我是諾曼‧斯柏曼 和他一起參加阿凡達訓練
Sorry, I'm Norm. Spellman. I went through avatar training with him.

89
00:08:07,444 --> 00:08:09,400
...這是實驗室
...into the bio-lab.

90
00:08:10,155 --> 00:08:14,650
我們將花大量時間在這 好嗎？我是諾曼，阿凡達駕馭員
We're gonna spend a lot of time up here. Hey! How you doing? Norm, avatar driver.

91
00:08:16,119 --> 00:08:17,661
鏈接…這邊是鏈接室
Link... Here's the link room right here.

92
00:08:17,787 --> 00:08:20,028
我們鏈接到阿凡達的地方
This is where we're connecting to the avatar.

93
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:23,914
我和諾曼就是到這來駕馭阿凡達
Me and Norm are here to drive

94
00:08:24,043 --> 00:08:27,162
這些遠程遙控的身體
these remotely controlled bodies called avatars.

95
00:08:27,296 --> 00:08:32,253
是由人類DNA和土著混合產生
And they're grown from human DNA mixed with the DNA of the natives.

96
00:08:32,384 --> 00:08:34,293
- 歡迎 - 嘿
- Hey. Welcome. - Hey.

97
00:08:34,428 --> 00:08:36,753
- 歡迎到潘朵拉，你能來真好 - 謝謝
- Welcome to Pandora. Good to have you. - Thanks.

98
00:08:38,807 --> 00:08:40,633
靠！他們真大
Damn! They got big.

99
00:08:40,767 --> 00:08:43,257
是啊，他們在運送途中成熟了
Yeah, they fully mature on the flight out.

100
00:08:43,394 --> 00:08:45,682
催長液看來蠻有效
So the proprioceptive sims seem to work really well.

101
00:08:45,813 --> 00:08:47,639
是啊，長得多健壯
Yeah, they've got great muscle tone.

102
00:08:47,774 --> 00:08:49,600
你不知道運送他們多麻煩
It'll take us a few hours to get them decanted,

103
00:08:49,734 --> 00:08:51,607
但你們明天就能用了
but you guys can take them out tomorrow.

104
00:08:52,153 --> 00:08:53,481
那個是你的
There's yours.

105
00:08:55,198 --> 00:08:56,775
你好，諾曼‧斯柏曼博士
Hey. Dr. Norm Spellman.

106
00:08:56,907 --> 00:08:59,741
- 邁斯博士，很高興見到你 - 很高興見到你
- Dr. Max Patel. Great to meet you. - Good to meet you, yeah.

107
00:09:23,682 --> 00:09:25,140
真像他
Looks like him.

108
00:09:26,435 --> 00:09:28,226
不，真像你
No, it looks like you.

109
00:09:29,354 --> 00:09:31,263
現在是你的阿凡達了，傑克
This is your avatar now, Jake.

110
00:09:34,567 --> 00:09:38,895
每個駕馭員都有自己唯一的阿凡達
And the concept is that every driver is matched to his own avatar,

111
00:09:40,032 --> 00:09:41,775
他們的神經系統才能同頻
so that their nervous systems are in tune,

112
00:09:43,201 --> 00:09:44,611
之類的
or something.

113
00:09:45,995 --> 00:09:50,371
他們給我機會 因我能鏈接湯米的阿凡達
Which is why they offered me the gig, because I can link with Tommy's avatar,

114
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:53,284
而阿凡達造價極高
which is insanely expensive.

115
00:09:54,086 --> 00:09:57,501
真可以嗎？ 我可以錄任何想說的？
Is this right? I just say whatever to the video log?

116
00:09:57,631 --> 00:09:59,753
可以，我們要養成 記錄一切的好習慣
Yeah, we gotta get in the habit of documenting everything.

117
00:09:59,883 --> 00:10:01,875
我們看到的，我們感覺的
You know, what we see, what we feel.

118
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:04,679
- 這就是科學 - 好的科學來源於好的觀察
- It's all part of the science. - And good science is good observation.

119
00:10:04,805 --> 00:10:07,176
另外，接下來6年裡 還能讓你保持理智
Plus it'll help to keep you sane for the next six years.

120
00:10:07,307 --> 00:10:10,058
好吧
All right. Whatever.

121
00:10:12,061 --> 00:10:13,685
那麼…
So...

122
00:10:14,772 --> 00:10:16,182
說到哪了
Well, here I am,

123
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,358
做研究
doing science.

124
00:10:20,569 --> 00:10:22,111
他們出來了！
They're coming out!

125
00:10:22,237 --> 00:10:24,692
注意，駕馭員脫離鏈接
Attention. Drivers coming out of link.

126
00:10:31,914 --> 00:10:33,372
天啊
Oh, God.

127
00:10:35,292 --> 00:10:36,999
試驗服在哪？ 試驗服在哪？
Where's the lab coat? Where's the lab coat?

128
00:10:37,127 --> 00:10:43,413
誰拿著我的雪茄？ 這是怎麼回事？
Who's got my goddamn cigarette? Guys! What's wrong with this picture?

129
00:10:44,592 --> 00:10:47,960
- 謝謝 - 格蕾絲‧奧古斯丁是個傳說
- Thank you! - Grace Augustine is a legend.

130
00:10:48,095 --> 00:10:50,550
她是阿凡達計畫的領頭人 她還寫了書
She's the head of the Avatar Program. She wrote the book,

131
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:53,384
親自寫下潘朵拉植物學著作
I mean, literally wrote the book on Pandoran botany.

132
00:10:53,516 --> 00:10:55,722
那是因為 比起人類，她更喜歡植物
Well, that's 'cause she likes plants better than people.

133
00:10:56,311 --> 00:10:58,102
她來了 灰姑娘從舞會回來
Here she is, Cinderella back from the ball.

134
00:10:58,272 --> 00:11:01,889
格蕾絲，我給你介紹 諾曼和傑克
Grace, I'd like you to meet Norm Spellman and Jake Sully.

135
00:11:03,693 --> 00:11:07,357
諾曼，我聽過你的事蹟 你的納美語怎樣？
Norm. I hear good things about you. How's your Na'vi?

136
00:11:08,447 --> 00:11:10,605
願全能的聖母…
May the All Mother...

137
00:11:10,783 --> 00:11:12,775
…眷顧我們第一次的見面
...smile upon our first meeting.

138
00:11:12,951 --> 00:11:16,070
不壞，還比較正式
Not bad. You sound a little formal.

139
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:19,452
我學了5年…
I studied for five years...

140
00:11:19,624 --> 00:11:21,616
…還只初窺門徑
...but there is much to learn.

141
00:11:21,877 --> 00:11:25,328
- 格蕾絲，這位是傑克 - 女士
- Grace? This is Jake Sully. - Ma'am.

142
00:11:25,922 --> 00:11:29,919
行了，我知道你是誰. 我不要你，要的是你兄弟
Yeah, yeah. I know who you are, and I don't need you. I need your brother.

143
00:11:30,051 --> 00:11:33,633
為這任務學了三年的博士
You know, the PhD who trained for three years for this mission?

144
00:11:33,763 --> 00:11:35,138
他死了
He's dead.

145
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:38,178
我知道給對大家造成不便
I know it's a big inconvenience for everyone.

146
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:42,595
- 你進過多少次試驗室？ - 我解剖過青蛙
- How much lab training have you had? - I dissected a frog once.

147
00:11:44,022 --> 00:11:47,188
看到沒？ 他欺負我們
You see? You see? I mean, they're just pissing on us

148
00:11:47,318 --> 00:11:49,606
都不帶掩飾的
without even the courtesy of calling it rain.

149
00:11:49,737 --> 00:11:50,934
- 我去找帕克 - 別啊，格蕾絲
- I'm going to Selfridge. - No, Grace,

150
00:11:51,071 --> 00:11:53,608
- 我想最好別去 - 不行，這簡直是亂來
- I don't think that's a good idea. - No, man, this is such bullshit!

151
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:55,115
我必須去教訓他一下
I'm gonna kick his corporate butt.

152
00:11:55,242 --> 00:11:58,076
他憑什麼插手我的部門
He has no business sticking his nose in my department.

153
00:11:59,162 --> 00:12:02,910
明天早上8點到這 試著說好聽的
Here tomorrow, 0800. Try and use big words.

154
00:12:11,256 --> 00:12:15,123
蠍子二號，這是塔樓 你可以從南方起飛
Scorpion Two-Hotel, Hell's Gate tower. You are cleared for south departure.

155
00:12:23,977 --> 00:12:25,174
- 看到沒有？ - 是的，長官
- You see that? - Yes, sir.

156
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:27,350
胡說，你沒看 你在看顯示器
No, you didn't. You were looking at the monitor.

157
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,350
我愛這根桿！ 我愛死它了！
I love this putter, Ronnie! I love this putter.

158
00:12:33,235 --> 00:12:37,446
帕克，我以為你是疏忽
Parker, you know, I used to think it was benign neglect,

159
00:12:37,573 --> 00:12:40,490
現在我知道你是故意破壞我
but now I see that you're intentionally screwing me.

160
00:12:40,618 --> 00:12:44,116
格蕾絲，我喜歡和你談話
Grace, you know, I enjoy our little talks.

161
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:51,951
我要研究員 不是退伍大兵
I need a researcher. Not some jarhead dropout.

162
00:12:52,086 --> 00:12:53,710
其實，我覺得找到他滿走運的
Well, actually, I thought we got lucky with him.

163
00:12:53,838 --> 00:12:55,296
- 幸運？ - 是啊
- Lucky? - Yeah.

164
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:57,379
這還談得上走運？
How is this in any way lucky?

165
00:12:57,508 --> 00:12:59,215
走運的是 還有個雙胞胎
Lucky your guy had a twin brother,

166
00:12:59,343 --> 00:13:02,213
而且走運的是 他兄弟不是個小白臉
and lucky that brother wasn't some oral hygienist or something.

167
00:13:02,596 --> 00:13:04,220
我們需要個軍人
A Marine we can use.

168
00:13:04,348 --> 00:13:06,174
我派他去給你做護衛
I'm assigning him to your team as security escort.

169
00:13:06,308 --> 00:13:09,723
我最不需要的 就是亂開槍的白痴
The last thing I need is another trigger-happy moron out there!

170
00:13:09,853 --> 00:13:11,679
你看 你的任務是贏得土著人的心
Look, look, you're supposed to be winning the hearts

171
00:13:11,813 --> 00:13:12,808
還有他們的信任
and the minds of the natives.

172
00:13:12,939 --> 00:13:14,730
這難道不是你的公仔戲？
Isn't that the whole point of your little puppet show?

173
00:13:14,858 --> 00:13:16,316
外表像他們，說話像他們
If you look like them and you talk like them,

174
00:13:16,443 --> 00:13:18,067
就能贏得信任
then they'll start trusting us.

175
00:13:18,194 --> 00:13:20,150
我們建了學校，教他們英語
We build them a school, we teach them English,

176
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:22,235
但是過了多久？
but after, what, how many years?

177
00:13:22,365 --> 00:13:23,859
雙方的關係越來越惡化
Relations with the indigenous are only getting worse.

178
00:13:23,991 --> 00:13:27,193
當你用機關鎗 就有這結果
Yeah, that tends to happen when you use machine guns on them.

179
00:13:27,327 --> 00:13:29,402
好吧，過來這
Right. Come here.

180
00:13:30,498 --> 00:13:32,241
我不能…
I can't... I can't...

181
00:13:35,502 --> 00:13:38,419
這是我們來的原因： 「鎢氪取」礦石
This is why we're here. Unobtanium.

182
00:13:38,547 --> 00:13:41,583
因為這灰石頭能賣兩千萬每克
Because this little gray rock sells for 20 million a kilo.

183
00:13:41,716 --> 00:13:44,918
因為這 才有人給我們投資
That's the only reason. It's what pays for the whole party.

184
00:13:45,053 --> 00:13:46,879
才有人讚助你的研究
It's what pays for your science.

185
00:13:48,306 --> 00:13:51,390
現在那些野蠻人 危脅到我們整個行動
Now, those savages are threatening our whole operation,

186
00:13:51,517 --> 00:13:52,714
戰爭一觸即發
we're on the brink of war,

187
00:13:52,851 --> 00:13:56,017
你的任務是尋求外交解決
and you're supposed to be finding a diplomatic solution.

188
00:13:56,147 --> 00:13:59,598
用你手頭上的資源 給我點結果
So use what you've got, and get me some results.

189
00:14:10,535 --> 00:14:13,025
你有過多少鏈接時間？
 So, how much link time have you logged?

190
00:14:13,162 --> 00:14:16,744
- 大概520小時 - 很好
 - About 520 hours. - That's good.

191
00:14:16,874 --> 00:14:21,167
你在這邊 你在這裡，你呢，多少時間？
 You're in there. You're here. How much have you logged?

192
00:14:21,296 --> 00:14:23,917
零，但我讀過說明
 Zip. But I read a manual.

193
00:14:24,924 --> 00:14:26,916
你開玩笑吧
 Tell me you're joking.

194
00:14:28,302 --> 00:14:29,630
真是酷
 This is cool.

195
00:14:30,179 --> 00:14:31,507
我們走
 Let's go.

196
00:14:35,475 --> 00:14:37,134
不用，我自己來
 Don't. I got this.

197
00:14:41,564 --> 00:14:44,101
你把自己放到這裡
 So you just figured you'd come out here,

198
00:14:44,233 --> 00:14:46,806
這個對人類最危險的環境
 to the most hostile environment known to man,

199
00:14:46,945 --> 00:14:50,645
聽天由命？
 with no training of any kind, and see how it went?

200
00:14:50,781 --> 00:14:53,022
你腦子在想什麼？
 What was going through your head?

201
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:55,945
也許我聽膩了 醫生說我什麼不能做
 Maybe I was sick of doctors telling me what I couldn't do.

202
00:14:57,079 --> 00:14:59,320
- 生物統計正常 - 3個鏈接就緒
 - Biometrics are good. - Link three is ready.

203
00:14:59,873 --> 00:15:04,084
手放進去，低頭
 Keep your arms in, hands in, head down.

204
00:15:05,253 --> 00:15:09,001
低頭，放輕鬆 腦袋放空白
 Down. Just relax and let your mind go blank.

205
00:15:09,715 --> 00:15:11,588
這對你不難
 That shouldn't be hard for you.

206
00:15:11,718 --> 00:15:13,509
親我的菊花…
 Kiss the darkest part of my lily white...

207
00:15:13,678 --> 00:15:15,006
開始鏈接
 Initiate link.

208
00:15:15,888 --> 00:15:18,295

213
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,244

我從四號進入

216
00:16:11,023 --> 00:16:16,858
他來了，聽得見嗎？ 聽見我嗎，傑克？

- 拇指觸摸指頭 - 好

很好，你還記得這個

 Are you feeling lightheaded or dizzy at all? You're wiggling your toes!

- 好，好，傑克 - 很不錯

很不錯，傑克，等一等
That's great, Jake. Hold on, now.

234
00:16:59,569 --> 00:17:01,775
別緊張 不要太心急
Take it easy. Don't get ahead of yourself, okay?

235
00:17:01,904 --> 00:17:04,394
還有幾項反應測試
There's a few more sensory motor reflex tests we need to run,

236
00:17:04,532 --> 00:17:06,571
- 別著急 - 等等

聽著，為了你的安全，先坐下
Listen to me. For your own safety, you need to sit down.

243
00:17:20,881 --> 00:17:23,632
阿凡達需要時間適應 傑克
You need time to adjust to the avatar... Whoa! Jake!

244
00:17:23,758 --> 00:17:25,964
- 天啊，傑克小心尾巴 - 好棒

00:17:33,767 --> 00:17:35,142
- 傑克，別這樣 - 聽我說
- Jake. Come on. - Jake! Listen to me.

248
00:17:35,269 --> 00:17:36,811
你不適應阿凡達
You're not used to your avatar body.

249
00:17:36,937 --> 00:17:38,561
- 這很危險 - 這很棒！
- This is dangerous. - This is great.

250
00:17:38,689 --> 00:17:41,891
- 傑克？聽我說 - 別這樣，他們會把你放倒
- Jake? Jake, listen to me. - Come on. They're gonna put you out.

- 諾曼，坐下 - 不行，我要取下這些線
- Norm, sit down. - No, no. I gotta get out of these leads.

252
00:17:47,281 --> 00:17:48,823
我的天，帶他們回來
God damn it! Bring them home!

253
00:17:48,949 --> 00:17:51,522
- 諾曼，不許離開控制 - 你還沒準備好
- Norm! Do not leave control! - You're not ready for it!

254
00:17:53,328 --> 00:17:57,159
- 來啊，你不會沒種吧？ - 差一點
- Oh, come on, you ain't got no skills. - So close!

255
00:17:57,290 --> 00:17:58,832
我甚至不用防守
I don't even have to play defense on it.

256
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:00,368
你好，夥計們
Hey, guys. Hey.

257
00:18:00,501 --> 00:18:02,742
- 沒事，我來抓他 - 傑克，你必須回去
－It's okay, I'll get him. - Jake, you have to come back!

258
00:18:02,878 --> 00:18:04,621
傑克！等等
Jake! Jake! Excuse me.

259
00:18:07,215 --> 00:18:08,792
- 小心 - 抱歉
- Watch it! - Sorry!

260
00:18:08,925 --> 00:18:10,335
來吧！
Come on!

261
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:14,304
傑克！不允許我們跑步的
Jake! We're not supposed to be running!

262
00:18:23,898 --> 00:18:26,223
- 天啊，對不起 - 注意點！
- Jeez! Sorry. - Watch it!

263
00:18:48,546 --> 00:18:50,040
你好，大兵
Hey, Marine!

264
00:18:50,923 --> 00:18:52,251
該死
Damn.

265
00:18:54,343 --> 00:18:57,462
- 格蕾絲？ - 你以為呢？
- Grace? - Well, who'd you expect, numbnuts?

266
00:18:58,764 --> 00:19:00,222
接住
Think fast.

267
00:19:01,099 --> 00:19:03,257
反應還可以
Motor control's looking good.

268
00:19:13,153 --> 00:19:17,446
大家靜下來，熄燈
Come on, everybody, quiet down! All right, gang, lights out.

269
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,651
來吧，路易斯，睡吧
Come on, Louise, chop-chop.

270
00:19:21,744 --> 00:19:23,950
別搗鼓那個，你會瞎的
Don't play with that, you'll go blind.

271
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:25,489
這真怪異
That's kind of freaky.

272
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:28,029
好了，斯科特
Come on. Scat.

273
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:30,411
晚安
Good night.

274
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:35,255
熄燈！晚餐見，孩子們
Lights out! See you at dinner, kiddies.

275
00:19:59,321 --> 00:20:00,316
歡迎回來
Welcome back.

276
00:20:08,287 --> 00:20:10,612
- 你還好吧？ - 嗯，還好
- You okay? You all right? - Yeah, I'm okay.

277
00:20:12,374 --> 00:20:17,580
我叫楚蒂，負責科研飛行 這是我的寶貝
I'm Trudy. I fly all the science sorties. And this here is my baby.

278
00:20:18,213 --> 00:20:19,837
等等
Hold on a second.

279
00:20:20,383 --> 00:20:23,253
威夫力，搞好它
Hey, Wainfleet! Get it done!

280
00:20:23,719 --> 00:20:27,846
- 我們9點出發 - 交給我吧，上尉
- We bounce at zero-nine. - Yeah, I'm on it, capitaine!

281
00:20:28,557 --> 00:20:30,513
重機槍還有點鬆
Vine strike's still loose.

282
00:20:30,642 --> 00:20:32,764
你們的武器還挺厲害
You guys are packing some heavy gear.

283
00:20:32,894 --> 00:20:34,174
小心
Watch it!

284
00:20:34,896 --> 00:20:37,517
是啊，因為天空中不只有我們
Yeah, that's 'cause we're not the only thing flying around out there.

285
00:20:37,648 --> 00:20:39,272
有更大的
Or the biggest.

286
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:42,186
我需要你控制艙門槍 人手不夠
I'm gonna need you on a door gun. I'm a man short.

287
00:20:42,319 --> 00:20:44,062
還以為你不會提
I thought you'd never ask.

288
00:20:45,448 --> 00:20:48,567
那是你要的人 起飛再見
There's your man. See you on the flight line.

289
00:20:59,335 --> 00:21:01,706
你想見我，上校？
You wanted to see me, Colonel?

290
00:21:01,838 --> 00:21:04,375
低引力會讓你軟弱
This low gravity'll make you soft.

291
00:21:05,883 --> 00:21:07,377
一旦你軟弱
You get soft,

292
00:21:10,638 --> 00:21:13,887
潘朵拉會立刻要你的命
Pandora will shit you out dead with zero warning.

293
00:21:15,017 --> 00:21:17,554
我看了你的檔案，下士
I pulled your record, Corporal.

294
00:21:17,686 --> 00:21:20,057
委內瑞拉，那裡很艱苦
Venezuela, that was some mean bush.

295
00:21:22,065 --> 00:21:24,306
但也比不上這
Nothing like this here, though.

296
00:21:26,611 --> 00:21:29,944
你很有種，小子 敢到這裡來
You got some heart, kid, showing up in this neighborhood.

297
00:21:30,072 --> 00:21:31,898
我想只不過是另一個地獄
I figured it's just another hellhole.

298
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:34,403
我也曾是第一偵查隊
I was First Recon myself.

299
00:21:34,535 --> 00:21:37,737
在你前幾年 或者不止幾年
A few years ahead of you. Well, maybe more than a few.

300
00:21:38,706 --> 00:21:41,576
去三趟尼日利亞，沒留一點傷
Three tours Nigeria, not a scratch.

301
00:21:41,709 --> 00:21:43,119
結果到這裡？
I come out here?

302
00:21:43,961 --> 00:21:47,210
第一天，就像新入伍一樣
Day one. Think I felt like a shavetail louie?

303
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:51,834
是啊，如果我回去 能治好這些
Yeah. They could fix me up, if I rotated back.

304
00:21:52,594 --> 00:21:57,588
讓我看起來更帥 但知道嗎？我喜歡這樣
Yeah, and make me pretty again. But you know what? I kind of like it.

305
00:21:57,723 --> 00:22:00,557
能每天提醒我 外面都有些什麼
It reminds me every day what's waiting out there.

306
00:22:02,604 --> 00:22:08,439
阿凡達計畫就是個笑話 一群娘娘腔科學家搞的
The Avatar Program is a bad joke. Bunch of limp-dick science majors.

307
00:22:08,567 --> 00:22:15,482
不過，也算創造了機會 時間上，還有這次
However, it does present an opportunity both timely and unique.

308
00:22:22,413 --> 00:22:27,537
一個陸戰隊員在阿凡達裡 多怪的組合
A recon gyrene in an avatar body. That's a potent mix.

309
00:22:27,669 --> 00:22:29,293
讓我起雞皮疙瘩
Give me the goose bumps.

310
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:32,788
這樣的人，能提供給我
Such a Marine could provide the intel I need,

311
00:22:32,924 --> 00:22:34,583
地面上的內部情報
right on the ground.

312
00:22:35,885 --> 00:22:37,794
就在敵人內部
Right in the hostiles' camp.

313
00:22:38,637 --> 00:22:43,927
聽著，傑克 我要你從內部學習這些野人
Look, Sully. I want you to learn these savages from the inside.

314
00:22:44,059 --> 00:22:45,683
我要你取得他們信任
I want you to gain their trust.

315
00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:47,517
我要知道怎麼逼他們合作
I need to know how to force their cooperation

316
00:22:47,645 --> 00:22:50,135
或者怎麼滅掉他們
or hammer them hard if they won't.

317
00:22:51,649 --> 00:22:53,855
- 我還跟格蕾絲博士一起？ - 表面上
- Am I still with Augustine? - On paper.

318
00:22:53,985 --> 00:22:58,064
你裝成那群科學家一樣
Yeah, you walk like one of her science pukes, you quack like one,

319
00:22:59,615 --> 00:23:01,157
但是對我匯報
but you report to me.

320
00:23:02,618 --> 00:23:04,361
能幫我這個忙嗎？
Can you do that for me, son?

321
00:23:05,954 --> 00:23:07,329
好的，長官
Hell, yeah, sir.

322
00:23:08,248 --> 00:23:09,991
那就好
Well, all right, then.

323
00:23:21,052 --> 00:23:23,922
小子，我會照顧自己人
Son, I take care of my own.

324
00:23:24,055 --> 00:23:25,134
你幫我幹活
You get me what I need,

325
00:23:25,264 --> 00:23:28,466
回去後我幫你找回雙腿
I'll see to it you get your legs back when you rotate home.

326
00:23:29,393 --> 00:23:30,851
你自己的腿
Your real legs.

327
00:23:33,564 --> 00:23:35,603
聽著真不錯，長官
That sounds real good, sir.

328
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,984
- 鏈接就緒！ - 分層鎖40%
- Link's ready! - Phase-lock 40%.

329
00:23:45,617 --> 00:23:48,701
閉上你的嘴 讓諾曼來交涉
Just keep your mouth shut and let Norm do the talking.

330
00:23:48,828 --> 00:23:52,326
5個同頻完畢，分層鎖90%
I have five congruencies. Phase-lock 90%.

331
00:23:52,457 --> 00:23:53,701
鏈接三就緒
Link three ready.

332
00:23:54,417 --> 00:23:56,041
好的，我來了
All right, I'm going in.

333
00:25:06,067 --> 00:25:08,438
關上它，我們要停留一會
Shut it down. We're gonna stay a while.

334
00:25:11,906 --> 00:25:15,654
- 諾曼！你的背包 - 背包
- Norm! Your pack. - Pack.

335
00:25:18,328 --> 00:25:22,277
留在這裡 一個拿槍的白痴就夠了
Stay with the ship. One idiot with a gun is enough.

336
00:25:24,793 --> 00:25:26,417
你說了算，博士
You the man, Doc.

337
00:26:03,037 --> 00:26:06,073
潘狐猴，沒有攻擊性
Prolemuris. They're not aggressive.

338
00:26:08,709 --> 00:26:12,160
放鬆，大兵，你讓我緊張
Relax, Marine. You're making me nervous.

339
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,333
他們怎麼知道我們來了
So, how will they know we're here?

340
00:26:20,471 --> 00:26:23,092
他們肯定注視著我們
I'm sure they're watching us right now.

341
00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:27,515
- 別停下，諾曼 - 大家跟上
- Keep moving, Norm. - Keep up, guys!

342
00:26:29,938 --> 00:26:33,520
- 我來了 - 掃瞄
- And here I go. - Scanning.

343
00:26:35,943 --> 00:26:39,109
這麼快？
Wow! It's that fast?

344
00:26:41,406 --> 00:26:43,445
- 很神奇，不是嗎？ - 是啊
- Amazing, isn't it? - Yeah.

345
00:26:43,576 --> 00:26:47,324
原來這是個信號轉換
So, that is signal transduction from this root

346
00:26:47,454 --> 00:26:51,036
從這個根部到另一個根部 我們取個樣本
to the root of the tree next to it. So, we should take a sample.

347
00:26:51,166 --> 00:26:52,790
好的，樣本
Okay. Sample.

348
00:26:54,753 --> 00:26:59,046
這可能是基於反射速度的電子信號
You know, it's probably electrical, based on the speed of the reaction.

349
00:26:59,757 --> 00:27:03,670
諾曼，你在用口水污染樣本
Norm, you've contaminated the sample with your saliva.

350
00:27:04,136 --> 00:27:05,879
對喔
Right.

351
00:27:33,747 --> 00:27:35,573
我動手了
So, here I go.

352
00:28:01,065 --> 00:28:04,896
別開槍 你只會惹怒它
Don't shoot. Don't shoot, you'll piss him off.

353
00:28:08,655 --> 00:28:10,232
他已經發怒了
It's already pissed off.

354
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:13,324
傑克，它鎧甲太厚了 相信我
Jake, that armor's too thick. Trust me.

355
00:28:19,207 --> 00:28:23,286
它感到領地的威脅 別跑，不然它會衝來
It's a territorial threat display. Do not run, or he'll charge.

356
00:28:23,961 --> 00:28:25,668
那我怎麼辦，請它跳舞
So, what do I do, dance with it?

357
00:28:26,172 --> 00:28:29,208
站著別動
Just hold your ground.

358
00:28:44,355 --> 00:28:46,680
是嗎？來啊！沒有種？
Yeah? Come on! What you got?

359
00:28:47,858 --> 00:28:49,814
害怕了？這就對了
Oh, yeah. Who's bad? That's right.

360
00:28:50,861 --> 00:28:53,186
知道我是誰了吧，爛貨
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about, bitch.

361
00:28:54,782 --> 00:28:57,319
對了 回去找媽媽安慰就對了
That's right, get your punk ass back to mommy.

362
00:28:57,451 --> 00:29:00,321
是啊，你個孬種 繼續跑啊
Yeah? Yeah, you got nothing. You keep running.

363
00:29:00,454 --> 00:29:03,407
下次要不再多帶點朋友來？
Yeah, and why don't you bring back some of your friends, huh?

364
00:29:06,543 --> 00:29:07,657
該死
Oh, shit.

365
00:29:19,514 --> 00:29:21,921
這回怎樣？ 跑不跑？
So what about this one? Run? Don't run? What?

366
00:29:23,392 --> 00:29:25,384
跑！快點跑！
Run! Definitely run!

367
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:13,184
要回去了，夥計們
I'm gonna have to call it, guys.

368
00:33:13,317 --> 00:33:16,151
上校規定 不許夜晚行動
We're not allowed to run night ops. Colonel's orders.

369
00:33:17,946 --> 00:33:21,148
抱歉，博士 他只能撐到明早了
I'm sorry, Doc, he's just gonna have to hang on till morning.

370
00:33:21,282 --> 00:33:22,824
他不可能撐到早上
He won't make it till morning.

371
00:35:15,765 --> 00:35:17,674
我沒時間陪你
I don't have all goddamn night.

372
00:35:18,559 --> 00:35:20,634
來啊！上啊！
Come on! Come on!

373
00:36:34,631 --> 00:36:36,208
等等，不要！
Hey, wait. Don't!

374
00:36:39,802 --> 00:36:40,833
棒極了
Great.

375
00:37:38,357 --> 00:37:41,855
你可能聽不懂
Look, I know you probably don't understand this,

376
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:49,152
但還是要謝謝
but thank you.

377
00:37:54,372 --> 00:37:55,747
謝謝你
Thank you.

378
00:37:59,752 --> 00:38:01,210
大開眼界
That was pretty impressive.

379
00:38:04,006 --> 00:38:06,876
如果沒有你 我可能早死翹翹了
I would have been screwed if you hadn't come along. It was...

380
00:38:10,512 --> 00:38:13,548
等一會，你去哪？
Hey, wait a second. Hey, where you going?

381
00:38:14,599 --> 00:38:16,009
等等我
Wait up!

382
00:38:16,810 --> 00:38:18,553
慢點
Just... Hey, slow down.

383
00:38:18,687 --> 00:38:21,687
等等，我只想說 謝謝 幫我殺了那些東西
Look, wait up, I just wanted to say thanks for killing those things.

384
00:38:22,857 --> 00:38:25,857
- 靠！ - 別謝
- Damn! - Don't thank.

385
00:38:26,777 --> 00:38:29,102
你不要為這感謝
You don't thank for this.

386
00:38:30,739 --> 00:38:34,606
這很悲傷，只有悲傷
This is sad. Very sad only.

387
00:38:35,577 --> 00:38:37,652
好吧，對不起
Okay. Okay. I'm sorry.

388
00:38:38,538 --> 00:38:40,281
不管怎樣，對不起了
Whatever I did, I am sorry.

389
00:38:43,835 --> 00:38:46,954
都是你的錯 他們本不會死
All this is your fault. They did not need to die.

390
00:38:47,881 --> 00:38:49,873
我的錯？被襲擊那個是我 壞人也是我？
My fault? They attacked me. How am I the bad guy?

391
00:38:50,007 --> 00:38:51,631
你的錯！
Your fault!

392
00:38:52,134 --> 00:38:54,838
- 你的錯！ - 冷靜，冷靜
- Your fault! - Easy. Easy.

393
00:38:54,970 --> 00:38:58,587
你像個嬰兒 亂七八糟，不知所謂
You're like a baby. Making noise, don't know what to do.

394
00:38:58,724 --> 00:39:00,134
冷靜
Easy.

395
00:39:02,435 --> 00:39:04,806
好吧，好吧
Fine. Fine.

396
00:39:06,065 --> 00:39:08,104
如果你這麼愛它們
If you love your little forest friends,

397
00:39:09,735 --> 00:39:11,526
為何還要救我？
why not let them just kill my ass?

398
00:39:12,570 --> 00:39:14,277
你怎麼想？
What's the thinking?

399
00:39:15,114 --> 00:39:17,783
- 為何救你？ - 是啊，為什麼救我？
- Why save you? - Yeah. Yeah, why save me?

400
00:39:22,288 --> 00:39:24,197
你有顆堅強的心
You have a strong heart.

401
00:39:26,333 --> 00:39:27,530
不懼怕
No fear.

402
00:39:32,089 --> 00:39:34,923
但很愚蠢！像嬰兒般無知
But stupid! Ignorant like a child.

403
00:39:41,347 --> 00:39:43,754
如果我這麼無知…
Well, if I'm like a child, then...

404
00:39:44,475 --> 00:39:46,597
你可以教教我
Look, maybe you should teach me.

405
00:39:46,727 --> 00:39:48,933
天空人學不會 你們不看
Sky People cannot learn. You do not See.

406
00:39:49,063 --> 00:39:50,854
那就教我看
Well, then teach me how to See.

407
00:39:50,981 --> 00:39:53,436
沒人能教你看
No one can teach you to See. - Whoa.

408
00:39:54,818 --> 00:39:57,225
聽著，我們不能聊聊？
Look, come on, can't we talk?

409
00:39:58,197 --> 00:40:02,064
比如，你從哪學的英語？ 格蕾絲博士的學校？
Say, where'd you learn to speak English? Dr. Augustine's school?

410
00:40:06,913 --> 00:40:08,620
你就像個嬰兒
You're like a baby.

411
00:40:14,837 --> 00:40:16,414
我需要你幫忙
I need your help.

412
00:40:17,506 --> 00:40:19,332
你不該來這
You should not be here.

413
00:40:20,342 --> 00:40:23,128
- 那就帶我走 - 不，回去
- Okay, take me with you. - No! Go back.

414
00:40:25,848 --> 00:40:26,843
不
No.

415
00:40:28,350 --> 00:40:29,547
回去
Go back.

416
00:40:51,205 --> 00:40:52,200
不！
No!

417
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:15,174
啥…
What...

418
00:41:19,023 --> 00:41:20,481
這是什麼？
What are they?

419
00:41:21,858 --> 00:41:23,814
聖樹的種子
Seeds of the Sacred Tree.

420
00:41:24,903 --> 00:41:26,527
純粹的精靈
Very pure spirits.

421
00:41:50,635 --> 00:41:52,544
這是為什麼？
What was that all about?

422
00:41:54,722 --> 00:41:55,753
來
Come.

423
00:41:57,266 --> 00:41:58,297
來！
Come!

424
00:42:00,561 --> 00:42:02,220
我們去哪裡？
Where are we going?

425
00:42:12,448 --> 00:42:13,527
來
Come.

426
00:42:18,203 --> 00:42:19,910
你叫什麼名？
What's your name?

427
00:42:20,038 --> 00:42:21,069
靠！
Shit!

428
00:42:46,604 --> 00:42:47,635
好吧
Okay.

429
00:42:50,399 --> 00:42:53,185
冷靜，大家冷靜
Calm people, calm.

430
00:42:58,950 --> 00:43:01,736
你在幹嘛，蘇泰
What are you doing, Tsu'tey?

431
00:43:04,246 --> 00:43:07,080
這兒禁止惡魔
These demons are forbidden here.

432
00:43:07,958 --> 00:43:10,199
有啟示
There has been a sign.

433
00:43:10,335 --> 00:43:12,623
而且這是巫後決定的事
This is a matter for the Tsahik.

434
00:43:17,466 --> 00:43:18,414
帶他走
Bring him.

435
00:43:20,052 --> 00:43:21,629
發生什麼事？
What's going on?

436
00:43:24,015 --> 00:43:25,046
等等
Wait.

437
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:29,637
怎麼回事？
What's happening?

438
00:43:30,563 --> 00:43:31,558
嘿！
Hey!

439
00:44:41,671 --> 00:44:42,915
父親…
Father...

440
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:45,583
…我敬愛你
...I see you.

441
00:44:57,394 --> 00:44:58,769
這生物…
This creature...

442
00:44:59,104 --> 00:45:02,140
…為何帶他到這？
...why do you bring him here?

443
00:45:03,608 --> 00:45:04,983
我原想殺他…
I was going to kill him...

444
00:45:05,319 --> 00:45:07,110
…但遇到伊娃的啟示
...but there was a sign from Eywa.

445
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:09,276
我說過…
I have said...

446
00:45:09,406 --> 00:45:11,564
…不許夢行人進來
...no dreawalker will come here.

447
00:45:11,699 --> 00:45:13,033
他說什麼？
What's he saying?

448
00:45:13,534 --> 00:45:15,941
他的異族氣味直熏鼻子
His alien smell fills my nose.

449
00:45:16,078 --> 00:45:17,073
喂，他說什麼？
Hey, what's he saying?

450
00:45:17,204 --> 00:45:19,955
父親在決定是否處決你
My father is deciding whether to kill you.

451
00:45:21,458 --> 00:45:24,375
你父親，很高興見到你
Your father. It's nice to meet you, sir.

452
00:45:28,006 --> 00:45:29,416
退後！
Step back!

453
00:45:31,635 --> 00:45:34,754
我來看看這異族人
I will look at this alien.

454
00:45:34,888 --> 00:45:36,430
這是我母親
That is Mother.

455
00:45:36,556 --> 00:45:40,469
她就是巫後 她能預測伊娃的意志
She is Tsahik. The one who interprets the will of Eywa.

456
00:45:41,352 --> 00:45:42,680
誰是伊娃？
Who's Eywa?

457
00:45:49,568 --> 00:45:51,275
你的名字？
What are you called?

458
00:45:52,278 --> 00:45:53,606
傑克
Jake Sully.

459
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:06,291
- 你為何來此？ - 我來此學習
- Why did you come to us? - I came to learn.

460
00:46:07,710 --> 00:46:10,627
我們試過教別的天空人
We have tried to teach other Sky People.

461
00:46:10,754 --> 00:46:14,087
杯已滿則水難進
It is hard to fill a cup which is already full.

462
00:46:15,592 --> 00:46:17,880
我的杯子絕對空，相信我
Well, my cup is empty, trust me.

463
00:46:19,179 --> 00:46:21,800
不信問問格蕾絲博士 我不是科學家
Just ask Dr. Augustine. I'm no scientist.

464
00:46:21,932 --> 00:46:23,307
你是什麼？
What are you?

465
00:46:25,602 --> 00:46:28,804
我是軍人
I was a Marine. A...

466
00:46:29,689 --> 00:46:32,310
鍋蓋頭部落的戰士
A warrior of the Jarhead clan.

467
00:46:32,775 --> 00:46:33,972
戰士
A warrior!

468
00:46:34,110 --> 00:46:35,520
我能隨便殺死他
I could kill him easily!

469
00:46:35,653 --> 00:46:36,815
我能輕易殺死他！ 不！
I could kill him easily! No!

470
00:46:37,363 --> 00:46:41,490
這個是我們見到的…
This is the first warrior dreawalker...

471
00:46:41,616 --> 00:46:43,442
…第一個夢行人戰士
...we have seen.

472
00:46:43,577 --> 00:46:46,328
我們要研究他
We need to learn more about him.

473
00:46:48,832 --> 00:46:50,658
我的女兒…
My Daughter...

474
00:46:50,792 --> 00:46:55,038
…就由你…
...you will teach him our way...

475
00:46:55,171 --> 00:46:58,539
…把我族的行為教給他
...to speak and walk as we do.

476
00:46:58,675 --> 00:47:02,209
為何是我？不公平…
Why me? That's not fair...

477
00:47:03,095 --> 00:47:07,174
已經決定 由我女兒傳授你我族之道
It is decided. My daughter will teach you our ways.

478
00:47:07,307 --> 00:47:10,841
好好學，傑克
Learn well, Jakesully.

479
00:47:11,686 --> 00:47:15,469
然後我們再看 能否治癒你的瘋疾
Then we will see if your insanity can be cured.

480
00:47:34,207 --> 00:47:35,665
晚上好
Good evening.

481
00:47:38,713 --> 00:47:40,456
不用起來
Please don't get up.

482
00:47:42,382 --> 00:47:43,662
打擾一下
Excuse me.

483
00:47:46,011 --> 00:47:47,125
抱歉
Sorry.

484
00:47:50,265 --> 00:47:51,972
你好嗎？
Hey, how you doing?

485
00:48:35,682 --> 00:48:37,923
- 傑克，傑克！ - 他在一號機
- Jake. Jake! - He's in alpha.

486
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:41,060
- 他正在出來 - 傑克！
- He's coming out right now. - Jake. Jake!

487
00:48:42,939 --> 00:48:45,939
加把勁，孩子，做得好
Come on back, kid. Come on. That's it.

488
00:48:47,652 --> 00:48:50,273
回來了，回來了
There you go. There you go, there you go.

489
00:48:50,404 --> 00:48:52,729
你沒事了，沒事了
You're okay. You're okay.

490
00:48:52,865 --> 00:48:55,735
嚇死我了 你眨眼快得像鐘擺
Damn! You were dug in like a tick.

491
00:48:58,871 --> 00:49:01,408
- 你的阿凡達可好？ - 還好，博士
- Is the avatar safe? - Yeah, Doc.

492
00:49:02,541 --> 00:49:05,245
你不會相信我去了哪
And you are not gonna believe where I am.

493
00:49:06,294 --> 00:49:09,247
我們最後看到的 是大兵的屁股…
The last thing we see is this Marine's ass

494
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:13,377
消失在灌木叢裡 後面還追了只閃雷獸
disappearing into the brush with this angry thanator coming after him.

495
00:49:13,509 --> 00:49:16,426
- 這種巧事，沒什麼經驗可說 - 太棒了
- Hey, it's not something you can teach. - That is awesome.

496
00:49:16,554 --> 00:49:18,842
不知道什麼原因
You know, for reasons I cannot fathom,

497
00:49:18,972 --> 00:49:22,221
奧馬地卡雅族選擇了你 上帝保佑
the Omaticaya have chosen you. God help us all.

498
00:49:23,769 --> 00:49:25,049
「鍋蓋頭部落」？
"Jarhead clan"?

499
00:49:26,689 --> 00:49:29,689
- 真的成功了？ - 我基本上是家族一員了
- And it worked? - Hey, I'm practically family.

500
00:49:30,817 --> 00:49:34,232
他們要研究我 我必須學會融入他們
They're gonna study me. I have to learn to be one of them.

501
00:49:34,362 --> 00:49:35,904
這是好的開始，小子
That's called taking the initiative, son.

502
00:49:36,030 --> 00:49:38,485
- 再來10個你這樣的就好了 - 聽著，傑克
- I wish I had 10 more like you. - Look, Sully. Sully.

503
00:49:38,616 --> 00:49:41,984
要找出那群藍猴子要什麼
Just find out what the blue monkeys want.

504
00:49:42,787 --> 00:49:48,540
我們提供給他們 醫藥，教育，道路
You know, I mean, we try to give them medicine, education, roads.

505
00:49:48,668 --> 00:49:50,459
但他們寧可選擇泥巴
But no, no, no, they like mud.

506
00:49:50,586 --> 00:49:54,453
更煩人的就是…
And that wouldn't bother me, it's just that they're...

507
00:49:55,090 --> 00:49:58,126
來人幫個忙，12區
Hey, can you... Can somebody just... Sector 12.

508
00:49:59,928 --> 00:50:03,047
走，走，停
Okay, go, go, go, stop. Stop...

509
00:50:03,181 --> 00:50:05,256
停下！我的天！
Rich, stop! That's... Jesus!

510
00:50:05,391 --> 00:50:11,428
他們該死的村子 恰好坐落在
Their damn village happens to be resting on the richest unobtanium deposit

511
00:50:11,563 --> 00:50:16,853
豐富的「鎢氪取」礦藏上 看看這寶貝！
within 200 klicks in any direction. I mean, look at all that cheddar!

512
00:50:20,656 --> 00:50:23,146
- 誰來喊他們搬家 - 猜猜看
- Well, who gets them to move? - Guess.

513
00:50:25,077 --> 00:50:28,575
- 假如他們不肯走？ - 看他們敢不敢
- What if they won't go? - I'm betting that they will.

514
00:50:29,122 --> 00:50:31,791
好了，好了，聽著
Okay, okay, okay, okay, hey. Look. Look.

515
00:50:32,667 --> 00:50:35,501
殺死原住民雖然影響不好
Killing the indigenous looks bad,

516
00:50:35,628 --> 00:50:39,328
但比起傳媒 股東們更介意的是…
but there's one thing that shareholders hate more than bad press,

517
00:50:39,466 --> 00:50:42,585
季度報表上的虧損 我無能為力
and that's a bad quarterly statement. I didn't make up the rules.

518
00:50:42,718 --> 00:50:45,837
給我想個法子 騙他們遷移
So just find me a carrot that'll get them to move,

519
00:50:46,639 --> 00:50:49,675
否則大家都不好過
otherwise it's gonna have to be all stick. Okay?

520
00:50:50,309 --> 00:50:54,009
在挖土機到達之前 你還有三個月
You got three months. That's when the 'dozers get there.

521
00:50:54,145 --> 00:50:56,054
你在浪費時間
Well, we're wasting time.

522
00:50:57,065 --> 00:50:58,144
我喜歡這傢伙
I like this guy.

523
00:50:58,399 --> 00:51:01,767
- 夥計們，現在… - 好吧，我們再過一遍
- Guys, right now... - Okay, let's run through them again.

524
00:51:01,902 --> 00:51:04,190
莫阿特，神秘的女士
Mo'at. Dragon lady.

525
00:51:06,241 --> 00:51:09,194
- 艾圖砍 - 艾圖看，他是部落酋長
- Eytucan. - Eytukan. He's the clan leader.

526
00:51:09,327 --> 00:51:12,411
但莫阿特才是精神領袖 就像薩滿巫師
But she's the spiritual leader. Like a shaman.

527
00:51:12,538 --> 00:51:14,080
明白
Got it.

528
00:51:14,206 --> 00:51:16,364
- 豬泰 - 蘇泰
- T'su'tey. - Tsu'tey.

529
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:19,204
- 蘇泰 - 他將是下任酋長
- Tsu'tey. - He'll be the next clan leader.

530
00:51:21,254 --> 00:51:23,709
- 娜塔瑞 - 她將是下任巫後
- Neytiri. - She'll be the next Tsahik.

531
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:25,749
他們將是夫妻領袖
They become a mated pair.

532
00:51:26,801 --> 00:51:29,089
- 那誰是伊娃？ - 誰是伊娃？
- So who's this Eywa? - Who's Eywa?

533
00:51:30,055 --> 00:51:33,589
他們唯一的女神 一切生靈的集合
Only their deity. Their goddess, made up of all living things.

534
00:51:33,725 --> 00:51:35,053
是他們知道的一切
Everything they know!

535
00:51:35,184 --> 00:51:37,223
哪怕學過一點點 都會知道這個
You'd know this if you had any training whatsoever.

536
00:51:37,353 --> 00:51:38,681
不知誰約到了酋長女兒
Who's got a date with the chief's daughter?

537
00:51:38,813 --> 00:51:40,437
- 算了吧，那是… - 好了，你兩個住嘴吧
- Come on. That's... - All right, knock it off, you two.

538
00:51:40,564 --> 00:51:43,054
走吧，村莊開始很早
Let's go. Village life starts early.

539
00:51:45,277 --> 00:51:47,732
別做特別的蠢事
Don't do anything unusually stupid.

540
00:52:06,797 --> 00:52:08,077
放鬆，小子
Easy, boy.

541
00:52:08,757 --> 00:52:10,796
帕蕾是母性
Pale is female.

542
00:52:13,803 --> 00:52:16,174
好吧，放鬆，姑娘
Okay. Easy, girl.

543
00:52:44,999 --> 00:52:48,699
這是「紮黑魯」，紐帶
That is tsaheylu. The bond.

544
00:52:50,922 --> 00:52:52,119
感受她
Feel her.

545
00:52:55,343 --> 00:52:59,387
感受她的心跳，她的呼吸
Feel her heartbeat. Her breath.

546
00:53:02,432 --> 00:53:04,175
感受她強壯的腿
Feel her strong legs.

547
00:53:06,686 --> 00:53:08,974
你可以告訴她幹什麼
You may tell her what to do.

548
00:53:09,105 --> 00:53:10,267
裡面
Inside.

549
00:53:11,274 --> 00:53:14,144
現在，說出方向
For now, say where to go.

550
00:53:17,197 --> 00:53:18,394
前進！
Forward!

551
00:53:36,047 --> 00:53:39,131
- 你該離開 - 不，你會想念我的
- You should go away. - No, you'd miss me.

552
00:53:40,594 --> 00:53:42,835
你就知道你會英語
I knew you could speak English.

553
00:53:45,390 --> 00:53:47,465
異族人一竅不通…
This alien will learn nothing...

554
00:53:47,975 --> 00:53:49,517
…石頭都比他開竅…
...a rock sees more...

555
00:53:49,977 --> 00:53:51,768
…看他那樣
...look at him.

556
00:54:01,237 --> 00:54:02,232
再來
Again.

557
00:54:02,363 --> 00:54:05,778
如果要進攻 情況會很複雜
If you want to hit this thing, it's gonna be complicated.

558
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:08,364
你的掃瞄看不到內部結構
Your scan doesn't show the internal structure.

559
00:54:08,495 --> 00:54:10,487
外面有一圈石柱
There's an outer row of columns.

560
00:54:10,622 --> 00:54:13,326
防守嚴密 這裡還有一圈
Real heavy duty. There's a secondary ring here,

561
00:54:13,458 --> 00:54:17,040
還有內圈 有個塔形結構
and an inner ring. There's a core structure like a spiral.

562
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:19,544
用來上下移動
That's how they move up and down.

563
00:54:19,672 --> 00:54:22,458
我們需要每個石柱 的詳細掃瞄
We're gonna need accurate scans on every column.

564
00:54:22,591 --> 00:54:23,871
收到
Roger that.

565
00:54:24,009 --> 00:54:26,630
關於結構 你還能提供什麼？
What else can you tell us about the structure?

566
00:54:26,761 --> 00:54:29,547
我估計第二環 同時也是承重環
I'm guessing this secondary ring, that's also load-bearing.

567
00:54:34,102 --> 00:54:37,553
- 我們去哪？ - 出去避避
- So where are we going? - Getting out of Dodge.

568
00:54:38,940 --> 00:54:43,067
我不會讓帕克和邁爾斯為所欲為
I'm not about to let Selfridge and Quaritch micro-manage this thing.

569
00:54:43,194 --> 00:54:46,396
在26區還有個移動鏈接點
There's a mobile link up at Site 26 we can work out of,

570
00:54:46,530 --> 00:54:48,439
在高山上
way up in the mountains.

571
00:54:49,241 --> 00:54:51,529
哈利路亞山？
The Hallelujah Mountains?

572
00:54:51,660 --> 00:54:53,901
- 沒錯 - 說真的？
- That's right. - Are you serious?

573
00:54:54,038 --> 00:54:55,911
- 是啊 - 好啊
- Yeah. - Yes!

574
00:54:59,418 --> 00:55:03,082
潘朵拉傳說中的懸浮山 沒聽過？
The legendary floating mountains of Pandora. Heard of them?

575
00:55:16,642 --> 00:55:18,433
我們接近了
We're getting close.

576
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:21,181
是啊，看我的儀表
Yeah, look at my instruments.

577
00:55:21,313 --> 00:55:24,230
我們在亂流中
Yep. We're in the Flux Vortex.

578
00:55:24,358 --> 00:55:26,564
現在開始要目飛了
We're VFR from here on.

579
00:55:26,693 --> 00:55:28,519
什麼是目飛
What's VFR?

580
00:55:28,653 --> 00:55:30,941
就是肉眼找到你的目的地
Means you gotta see where you're going.

581
00:55:31,072 --> 00:55:34,939
- 但我什麼都看不到 - 對了，是不是有點刁
- You can't see anything. - Exactly. Ain't that a bitch?

582
00:55:53,510 --> 00:55:56,083
我的天
Oh, my God.

583
00:56:07,147 --> 00:56:08,475
看看你的表情
You should see your faces.

584
00:56:35,716 --> 00:56:38,087
謝謝您乘坐潘朵拉航空
Thank you for flying Air Pandora.

585
00:56:56,652 --> 00:56:58,194
歡迎到營地來
Welcome to camp.

586
00:57:02,074 --> 00:57:06,700
- 這是我的舖位 - 這裡真亂
- So, this is my bunk. - This stuff is nasty.

587
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:10,036
- 諾曼，你在下面 - 好的
- Norm, go under. - All right.

588
00:57:10,165 --> 00:57:13,616
- 格蕾絲都知道了 - 楚蒂，你用最上面的
- Grace didn't miss a thing. - Trudy, you'll take the top one.

589
00:57:13,752 --> 00:57:16,123
他知道我和上校談話
She knew I was talking to the Colonel.

590
00:57:16,254 --> 00:57:19,836
但是她需要 我的幫助回部落
But I had what she needed, a way back in with the clan,

591
00:57:19,966 --> 00:57:21,543
所以她假裝好人
so she's playing nice.

592
00:57:21,676 --> 00:57:26,670
傑克，向左拐 你的鏈接在最後
All right. Jake, hang a left. You'll be in the link at the end.

593
00:57:29,601 --> 00:57:33,645
一號機，它是故障最少的
Unit one. Beulah. She's the least glitchy.

594
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:24,180
我的天！
Holy shit!

595
00:58:25,153 --> 00:58:26,979
別盯她眼睛
Do not look in her eye.

596
00:58:35,579 --> 00:58:37,286
伊卡蘭不是馬
Ikran is not horse.

597
00:58:38,456 --> 00:58:40,282
一旦紐帶建立
Once tsaheylu is made,

598
00:58:44,170 --> 00:58:48,463
伊卡蘭從一而終
ikran will fly with only one hunter in the whole life.

599
00:58:58,433 --> 00:59:01,137
想要做獵人
To become taronyu, hunter,

600
00:59:01,269 --> 00:59:04,803
你要挑你的伊卡蘭 它也必須選擇你
you must choose your own ikran and he must choose you.

601
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:09,392
- 什麼時候？ - 你準備好的時候
- When? - When you are ready.

602
00:59:59,824 --> 01:00:02,943
好了，這是視頻日記12
Okay. This is video log 12.

603
01:00:04,162 --> 01:00:05,821
時間是2132
Time's 2132.

604
01:00:07,290 --> 01:00:10,623
必須得現在做嗎？ 我想要個架子
Do I have to do this now? I really need to get some rack.

605
01:00:10,752 --> 01:00:13,538
不行 乘記憶還新鮮
No, now. When it's fresh.

606
01:00:16,256 --> 01:00:18,047
好吧，地點：窩棚
Okay, location, shack,

607
01:00:19,051 --> 01:00:21,376
日子開始混淆了
and the days are starting to blur together.

608
01:00:23,513 --> 01:00:26,679
學語言真是痛苦，不過
The language is a pain, but, you know,

609
01:00:26,808 --> 01:00:29,927
我發現就像拆卸武器 不斷重複再重複就好了
I figure it's like field-stripping a weapon. Just repetition, repetition.

610
01:00:36,276 --> 01:00:38,268
更強些
Txur ni'ul. Stronger.

611
01:00:42,948 --> 01:00:46,565
娜塔瑞叫我「死干木」，意思是白痴
Neytiri calls me skxawng. It means moron.

612
01:00:48,912 --> 01:00:50,322
參與其中很重要
This is a very important part of it.

613
01:00:50,455 --> 01:00:52,530
- 諾曼的態度也有改善 - 我見你，我見你
- Norm 's attitude has improved lately. - I see you. I see you.

614
01:00:52,665 --> 01:00:54,990
但不僅僅是 「我見到你了」
But it's not just, "I'm seeing you in front of me,"

615
01:00:55,127 --> 01:00:56,751
而是「我見到你本質，我見你」
it's "I see into you. I See you."

616
01:00:56,878 --> 01:00:59,451
他回心轉意當然好 可他也認為我是「死干木」
It's good he's back on board, but he thinks I'm a skxawng, too.

617
01:00:59,589 --> 01:01:01,795
"我接受你，我明白你" 所以你一定要搞懂它，好吧？
"I'm accepting you. I understand you." So you gotta get this, okay?

618
01:01:02,175 --> 01:01:05,092
我要跑步了，來吧
I gotta run! Okay? Let's go.

619
01:01:05,928 --> 01:01:09,462
我雙腳越來越強 每天跑的距離都在增加
My feet are getting tougher. I can run farther every day.

620
01:01:11,391 --> 01:01:14,475
我必須相信身體的直覺
I have to trust my body to know what to do.

621
01:01:19,650 --> 01:01:21,309
好啊，快看
Yeah! Check it out!

622
01:01:22,152 --> 01:01:23,396
我靠
Oh, crap!

623
01:01:27,699 --> 01:01:32,526
每一天都是追蹤水塘裡的線索
Every day it's reading the trails, the tracks at the waterhole,

624
01:01:32,662 --> 01:01:34,820
都是些最微弱的氣味和聲音
the tiniest scents and sounds.

625
01:01:40,419 --> 01:01:45,163
她一直在談 能量的流動，動物的靈魂
She's always going on about the flow of energy, the spirits of animals.

626
01:01:46,008 --> 01:01:48,629
我真希望最後的考試 不是這個抱樹遊戲
I really hope this tree-hugger crap isn't on the final.

627
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:52,377
這不僅僅是手眼協調
This isn't just about eye-hand coordination out there, you know.

628
01:01:52,514 --> 01:01:55,135
你需要聆聽她的話
You need to listen to what she says.

629
01:01:55,266 --> 01:01:58,385
試著通過她的眼睛看森林
Try to see the forest through her eyes.

630
01:01:58,519 --> 01:02:01,056
不好意思，這是我的日記
Excuse me. This is my video log here.

631
01:02:16,495 --> 01:02:19,032
跟著娜塔瑞，不學快一點就完蛋了
With Neytiri, it's learn fast or die.

632
01:02:20,373 --> 01:02:22,448
你開玩笑吧
You gotta be kidding me.

633
01:02:51,569 --> 01:02:53,644
我和莫阿特談過 允許格蕾絲進入村莊
I talked Mo'at into letting Grace into the village.

634
01:02:53,779 --> 01:02:56,448
看你們長多大了
Look how big you are.

635
01:02:56,657 --> 01:02:57,403
從她學校關閉後 這是頭一次
It's the first time since her school was closed down.

636
01:02:57,533 --> 01:02:59,324
你真漂亮
You are so pretty.

637
01:03:00,828 --> 01:03:03,614
不行，給我回來
No, you don't. Come back here.

638
01:03:05,457 --> 01:03:06,488
祝你胃口好
Bon app谷tit.

639
01:03:34,109 --> 01:03:35,686
過來，大兵
Come on, Marine.

640
01:04:00,968 --> 01:04:03,589
我想要去理解 這深層的聯繫
I'm trying to understand this deep connection

641
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:05,926
人們和森林的聯繫
the people have to the forest.

642
01:04:06,431 --> 01:04:09,217
她談到一種能量網
She talks about a network of energy

643
01:04:10,059 --> 01:04:12,596
一切活著生物的能量
that flows through all living things.

644
01:04:13,521 --> 01:04:16,806
她說所有能量都是借來的
She says all energy is only borrowed,

645
01:04:17,775 --> 01:04:20,312
有一天終需歸還
and one day you have to give it back.

646
01:04:43,257 --> 01:04:44,288
我見你…
I see you...

647
01:04:44,467 --> 01:04:45,581
…兄弟
...Brother

648
01:04:46,094 --> 01:04:48,252
…也謝謝你
...and thank you.

649
01:04:52,433 --> 01:04:54,259
你的靈魂跟隨伊娃
Your spirit goes with Eywa.

650
01:04:54,935 --> 01:04:56,642
你的身體留在此處…
Your body stays behind...

651
01:04:56,978 --> 01:04:59,599
…變成人們的一份子
...to become part of The People.

652
01:05:03,401 --> 01:05:04,811
乾淨的手法
A clean kill.

653
01:05:08,197 --> 01:05:09,655
你準備好了
You are ready.

654
01:05:35,348 --> 01:05:38,681
學著駕馭它伊卡蘭，我們叫做班希斯
Learning to ride an ikran, we call them banshees,

655
01:05:38,810 --> 01:05:41,347
是每個年輕獵人必過的測試
is the test every young hunter has to pass.

656
01:05:43,606 --> 01:05:46,891
但這之前 你得去到班希斯的巢
But to do that, you gotta go where the banshees are.

657
01:06:20,473 --> 01:06:21,717
現在呢？
Now what?

658
01:07:51,726 --> 01:07:53,635
傑克先走
Jakesully will go first.

659
01:08:26,550 --> 01:08:30,499
現在你挑選伊卡蘭 用你內心去感受
Now you choose your ikran. This you must feel inside.

660
01:08:31,471 --> 01:08:34,388
如果它也選了你 像我一樣動作快點
If he also chooses you, move quick like I showed.

661
01:08:34,516 --> 01:08:37,302
只有一次機會
You will have one chance, Jake.

662
01:08:37,436 --> 01:08:39,511
怎麼知道它選了我？
How will I know if he chooses me?

663
01:08:39,646 --> 01:08:41,555
他會想吃掉你
He will try to kill you.

664
01:08:42,774 --> 01:08:44,149
多明顯
Outstanding.

665
01:09:44,456 --> 01:09:45,831
我們跳舞吧
Let's dance.

666
01:09:51,964 --> 01:09:53,790
這白痴死定了
That moron's going to die.

667
01:10:17,738 --> 01:10:19,445
別害怕，戰士
Don't be afraid, warrior.

668
01:10:19,615 --> 01:10:21,073
建紐帶
Make the bond!

669
01:10:24,536 --> 01:10:25,531
不！
No!

670
01:10:29,541 --> 01:10:30,572
傑克！
Jake!

671
01:10:44,680 --> 01:10:46,222
紮黑魯，傑克
Tsaheylu, Jake.

672
01:10:48,642 --> 01:10:49,839
紮黑魯！
Tsaheylu!

673
01:11:00,027 --> 01:11:01,058
停下！
Stop!

674
01:11:09,746 --> 01:11:14,822
這就對了，你是我的了
Yeah, that's right. You're mine. Huh?

675
01:11:28,095 --> 01:11:30,965
初次飛行鞏固紐帶 不要等
First flight seals the bond. You cannot wait.

676
01:11:32,516 --> 01:11:34,674
- 想著「飛」 - 飛？
- Think, "Fly!" - Fly?

677
01:11:43,318 --> 01:11:44,562
該死的
God damn!

678
01:11:59,709 --> 01:12:01,867
閉嘴，給我好好飛
Shut up and fly straight!

679
01:12:12,137 --> 01:12:14,425
這就對了，左轉
That's it. Bank left!

680
01:12:23,814 --> 01:12:25,557
平行，做得好
Level out! That's it.

681
01:12:31,072 --> 01:12:32,352
傑克！
Jakesully!

682
01:12:57,180 --> 01:12:58,211
嘿！
Hey!

683
01:13:04,311 --> 01:13:05,555
我們走！
Let's go!

684
01:13:18,033 --> 01:13:19,906
看，寶貝 我掌握了
Yeah, baby, I got this!

685
01:13:20,785 --> 01:13:21,982
該死
Oh, shit!

686
01:13:27,374 --> 01:13:31,038
騎馬我可能不在行 但這個我骨子裡就會！
I may not be much of a horse guy, but I was born to do this.

687
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:32,999
好啊
Yeah!

688
01:13:34,005 --> 01:13:37,041
- 我這樣過來，你在這 - 對
- I came like this. This you. - Yeah, yeah.

689
01:13:37,175 --> 01:13:42,132
- 我轉彎，感覺到風，轉得很強 - 我轉的很強烈
- I turn. I feel the wind. I turn very strong. - Look, yeah, see, I banked so hard...

690
01:14:44,238 --> 01:14:46,194
靈魂之樹
The Tree of Souls.

691
01:14:49,618 --> 01:14:51,776
他們最神聖的地方
It's their most sacred place.

692
01:14:52,621 --> 01:14:55,407
看這裡顯示的離子亂流
See the Flux Vortex in these false color images?

693
01:14:55,540 --> 01:14:57,579
對，就這影響我設備
Yeah, that's what messes up my instruments.

694
01:14:57,709 --> 01:15:02,204
那裡的生物學現象太有趣了
There is something really interesting going on in there biologically.

695
01:15:03,632 --> 01:15:05,671
我死都想去拿個樣本
I would die to get samples.

696
01:15:06,301 --> 01:15:09,087
外來人是禁入的
Outsiders are strictly forbidden.

697
01:15:09,220 --> 01:15:10,595
你這好運的豬
You lucky swine.

698
01:15:17,853 --> 01:15:21,553
我是高高在上的冷血殺手
I was a stone-cold aerial hunter. Death from above.

699
01:15:22,941 --> 01:15:25,894
問題是，不只你一個
Only problem is, you're not the only one.

700
01:15:29,823 --> 01:15:30,902
下潛！
Dive!

701
01:15:53,679 --> 01:15:54,841
衝，衝！
Go, go!

702
01:16:03,062 --> 01:16:04,342
跟我來！
Follow me!

703
01:16:50,857 --> 01:16:53,394
我們的人叫它：萊奧諾普暴龍獸
Our guys call it a Great Leonopteryx.

704
01:16:54,319 --> 01:16:57,355
它是托盧克，最後之影
It is Toruk. Last Shadow.

705
01:16:59,115 --> 01:17:02,199
當然了，死前最後看到就是它
Yeah, right. It's the last one you ever see.

706
01:17:06,873 --> 01:17:10,573
我爺爺的爺爺是托盧克 馬克托
My grandfather's grandfather was Toruk Macto.

707
01:17:11,293 --> 01:17:13,036
圖靈騎士
Rider of Last Shadow.

708
01:17:14,463 --> 01:17:15,873
他騎這東西？
He rode this?

709
01:17:17,590 --> 01:17:19,132
托盧克選擇了他
Toruk chose him.

710
01:17:19,551 --> 01:17:23,382
從初歌之日起，只發生過5次
It has only happened five times since the time of the First Songs.

711
01:17:23,512 --> 01:17:25,421
- 很長一段時間 - 是啊
- That's a long time. - Yes.

712
01:17:26,182 --> 01:17:28,055
托盧克 馬克托代表力量
Toruk Macto was mighty.

713
01:17:29,935 --> 01:17:33,635
在危機時刻，他把各部落團結一起
He brought the clans together in a time of great sorrow.

714
01:17:33,773 --> 01:17:36,061
所有納美人知道這故事
All Na'vi people know the story.

715
01:17:42,781 --> 01:17:46,944
一切都顛倒過來了 似乎那邊是真實世界
Everything is backwards now. Like out there is the true world

716
01:17:48,119 --> 01:17:50,075
這邊才是個夢
and in here is the dream.

717
01:18:10,640 --> 01:18:13,309
不敢相信 才經過了三個月
It's hard to believe it's only been three months.

718
01:18:16,437 --> 01:18:18,808
我幾乎忘記了過去
I can barely remember my old life.

719
01:18:22,401 --> 01:18:24,227
忘記了自己是誰
I don't know who I am anymore.

720
01:18:43,004 --> 01:18:45,790
沒有在木頭裡迷失吧？
Haven't gotten lost in the woods, have you?

721
01:18:49,010 --> 01:18:51,927
你上一份報告 都在兩週以前了
Your last report was more than two weeks ago.

722
01:18:54,181 --> 01:18:56,636
我開始懷疑你的決心
I'm starting to doubt your resolve!

723
01:18:59,228 --> 01:19:01,718
在我看來 是時候結束任務了
The way I see it, it's time to terminate the mission.

724
01:19:01,855 --> 01:19:03,646
不，我還能幹
No, I can do this.

725
01:19:03,773 --> 01:19:05,350
你已經做到了
You already have.

726
01:19:06,359 --> 01:19:08,517
你給了我寶貴的內部資料
You give me good, usable intel.

727
01:19:08,653 --> 01:19:10,811
還有靈魂之樹的地點
This Tree of Souls place.

728
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:14,648
當戰況不利時 我掌握了他們的命根子
Yeah, I got them by the balls with that when this turns into a shit fight,

730
01:19:17,453 --> 01:19:19,409
現在該回來了
Now it's time to come in.

731
01:19:20,915 --> 01:19:22,788
另外
By the way,

732
01:19:23,334 --> 01:19:25,290
我幫你找回另一條腿
you gonna get your legs back.

733
01:19:26,211 --> 01:19:29,745
對，我幫你徵得企業同意 已經定下了
Yeah. I got your corporate approval. It's a done deal.

734
01:19:29,881 --> 01:19:32,288
今晚送你回去
Gonna have you on a shuttle tonight.

735
01:19:32,425 --> 01:19:34,168
我是個講信用的
I'm a man of my word.

736
01:19:37,096 --> 01:19:38,839
我得有始有終
I gotta finish this.

737
01:19:41,142 --> 01:19:42,684
還差一件事
There's one more thing.

738
01:19:43,394 --> 01:19:48,351
儀式！成人的最後一步
Ceremony. It's the final stage of becoming a man.

739
01:19:50,901 --> 01:19:52,976
如果我完成了 就成為一份子了
If I do it, I'm one of them.

740
01:19:54,488 --> 01:19:56,231
他們就會相信我
And they'll trust me.

741
01:19:59,909 --> 01:20:03,075
然後就能勸他們搬家
And I can negotiate the terms of their relocation.

742
01:20:16,759 --> 01:20:19,214
那你就快點做，下士
Well, then, you'd better get it done, Corporal.

743
01:20:36,653 --> 01:20:40,602
納美人說 每個人都出生兩次
The Na 'vi say that every person is born twice.

744
01:20:42,658 --> 01:20:48,078
第二次，是你贏得了人們中的地位
The second time is when you earn your place among The People forever.

745
01:20:53,376 --> 01:20:57,871
你現在是奧馬地卡雅族的兒子了
You are now a son of the Omaticaya.

746
01:20:59,090 --> 01:21:02,339
你是人們的一分子了
You are part of The People.

747
01:21:48,679 --> 01:21:50,635
來，來
Come. Come.

748
01:22:08,280 --> 01:22:10,984
這裡是我們祈禱之地
This is a place for prayers to be heard.

749
01:22:12,617 --> 01:22:14,490
有時能聽到回應
And sometimes answered.

750
01:22:22,377 --> 01:22:24,998
我們叫這些樹霧圖愛雅
We call these trees Utraya Mokri.

751
01:22:26,047 --> 01:22:27,754
聲音之樹
The Tree of Voices.

752
01:22:29,842 --> 01:22:31,917
先祖的聲音
The voices of our ancestors.

753
01:22:46,983 --> 01:22:48,525
我能聽到他們
I can hear them.

754
01:22:53,531 --> 01:22:55,073
他們活著，傑克
They live, Jake,

755
01:22:57,201 --> 01:22:58,529
和伊娃一起
within Eywa.

756
01:23:02,747 --> 01:23:04,573
你現在是奧馬地卡雅族了
You are Omaticaya now.

757
01:23:05,376 --> 01:23:08,412
你可從家之樹取下材料 製成弓箭
You may make your bow from the wood of Hometree.

758
01:23:14,092 --> 01:23:16,131
你還能選擇一個女人
And you may choose a woman.

759
01:23:18,304 --> 01:23:20,213
你可選許多好女人
We have many fine women.

760
01:23:21,474 --> 01:23:23,430
泥納是最好的歌手
Ninat is the best singer.

761
01:23:26,353 --> 01:23:28,226
但我不想要泥納
But I don't want Ninat.

762
01:23:32,568 --> 01:23:34,477
培拉是個好獵手
Peyral is a good hunter.

763
01:23:36,196 --> 01:23:38,235
是啊，她真是好獵手
Yeah, she is a good hunter.

764
01:23:40,367 --> 01:23:42,074
但我已經選好
I've already chosen.

765
01:23:45,621 --> 01:23:48,076
可這女孩也必須選擇我
But this woman must also choose me.

766
01:23:52,127 --> 01:23:53,704
她也已經選好
She already has.

767
01:24:24,325 --> 01:24:26,234
我和你在一起了，傑克
I am with you now, Jake.

768
01:24:27,828 --> 01:24:29,654
我們是終身伴侶
We are mated for life.

769
01:24:36,044 --> 01:24:38,036
你到底在幹什麼，傑克？
What the hell are you doing, Jake?

770
01:25:08,829 --> 01:25:09,921
傑克！
Jake!

772
01:25:10,222 --> 01:25:11,478
別忘了相位整合
Don't forget your phase integration.

777
01:25:11,479 --> 01:25:12,227
- 傑克！ - 不，不，中間的按鈕
- Jake! - No, no, the middle button.

778
01:25:12,741 --> 01:25:14,129
- 你得吃點東西 - 對，就這個
- You gotta eat something. - Yeah, there you go.

779
01:25:22,387 --> 01:25:27,782
傑克！傑克，醒醒！傑克，求你了！
Jake! Jake. Wake up! Jake, please!

780
01:25:28,950 --> 01:25:30,841
別逼我強迫瘸子吃飯
Don't make me force-feed a cripple.

781
01:25:32,317 --> 01:25:33,622
格蕾絲，我不想…嘿！
Grace, I don't want... Hey!

782
01:25:37,988 --> 01:25:38,582
傑克！
Jake!

783
01:25:48,287 --> 01:25:49,256
好吧
Okay.

784
01:26:00,286 --> 01:26:01,386
給你，我吃完了，我們開始吧
Here. I'm done. Let's go.

785
01:26:02,535 --> 01:26:04,397
你上次洗澡是什麼時候？
And when was the last time you took a shower?

786
01:26:04,435 --> 01:26:06,474
- 我不需要洗澡 - 天哪，大兵
- I don't need a shower. - Jesus, Marine.

787
01:26:10,820 --> 01:26:12,018
傑克！
Jake!

788
01:26:18,827 --> 01:26:23,784
傑克！醒醒！傑克！醒醒！
Jake! Wake up! Jake! Wake up!

789
01:26:27,293 --> 01:26:28,573
嘿！
Hey!

790
01:26:29,337 --> 01:26:31,709
停下！停下！
Stop! Stop!

791
01:26:31,839 --> 01:26:34,590
- 傑克！ - 退回去，停下！
- Jake! - Go back, stop!

792
01:26:38,846 --> 01:26:40,126
嘿，老闆
Hey, boss.

793
01:26:40,639 --> 01:26:41,801
嘿！
Hey!

794
01:26:44,393 --> 01:26:45,472
- 怎麼了？ - 有個土著人
- What? - I got a native

795
01:26:45,602 --> 01:26:48,472
像小雞一樣跳來跳去，他攔著我的刀了
doing the funky chicken here. He's blocking my blade.

796
01:26:48,605 --> 01:26:51,689
繼續前進，他會跑開的
Well, keep going. He'll move.

797
01:26:51,816 --> 01:26:55,019
這些人必須瞭解我們是不會停的 快點，前進，前進，前進
These people have to learn that we don't stop. Come on, go, go, go.

798
01:26:57,405 --> 01:26:59,563
停下！嘿！
Stop! Hey!

799
01:26:59,699 --> 01:27:01,987
快跑！快跑！
Go! Go!

800
01:27:03,035 --> 01:27:04,410
看到沒？他跑開了
There, see? He moved.

801
01:27:16,840 --> 01:27:18,499
哥們，哥們，哇，哥們！哥們！不！
Dude, dude. Whoa, dude! Dude, no!

802
01:27:19,467 --> 01:27:20,747
我看不到了！
I'm blind.

803
01:27:32,646 --> 01:27:34,852
- 傑克！ - 娜塔瑞！
- Jake! - Neytiri!

804
01:27:36,483 --> 01:27:38,107
來，快跑！
Here, come on!

805
01:28:03,092 --> 01:28:05,582
在這裡暫停
Freeze it right there.

806
01:28:07,221 --> 01:28:09,628
拉近鏡頭，強化
Scale up. Enhance.

807
01:28:11,308 --> 01:28:12,802
狗娘養的
Son of a bitch.

808
01:28:14,352 --> 01:28:15,762
難以置信
Unbelievable.

809
01:28:16,896 --> 01:28:18,971
- 給我找個飛行員 - 是，先生
- Get me a pilot. - Yes, sir.

810
01:28:25,780 --> 01:28:28,068
蘇泰將領導戰爭
Tsu'tey will lead the war party.

811
01:28:34,621 --> 01:28:35,819
請停一下！
Stop please!

812
01:28:37,457 --> 01:28:39,414
這只會讓情況變得更糟
This will only make it worse.

813
01:28:39,626 --> 01:28:41,250
你別在這裡發表言論！
You do not speak here!

814
01:28:42,462 --> 01:28:44,288
我們要直搗他們的心臟
We will strike them in the heart.

815
01:28:52,055 --> 01:28:54,177
蘇泰！不要這麼做
Tsu'tey! Don't do this.

816
01:28:57,351 --> 01:28:58,845
- 你！ - 聽著，兄弟…
- You! - Listen. Brother...

817
01:29:04,358 --> 01:29:07,477
- 你和這個女人配對了？ - 噢，完蛋了
- You mated with this woman? - Oh, shit.

818
01:29:08,820 --> 01:29:10,729
是真的嗎？
Is this true?

819
01:29:12,324 --> 01:29:15,443
我們在伊娃面前結合，是既成事實
We are mated before Eywa. It is done.

820
01:29:16,870 --> 01:29:17,984
兄弟，請你
Brother, please.

821
01:29:18,121 --> 01:29:21,869
不要攻擊天空人，如果你攻擊他們的話 奧馬地卡雅部落會死很多人
Do not attack the Sky People. Many Omaticaya will die if you do.

822
01:29:21,999 --> 01:29:24,240
你不是我的兄弟！
You are not my brother!

823
01:29:27,505 --> 01:29:29,212
我不是你的敵人！
And I am not your enemy!

824
01:29:30,883 --> 01:29:33,717
敵人在那裡，他們非常強大！
The enemy is out there, and they are very powerful!

825
01:29:36,013 --> 01:29:37,756
衝！衝！衝！
Go! Go! Go!

826
01:29:41,017 --> 01:29:43,424
- 我能跟他們交涉 - 不要再交涉了
- I can talk to them. - No more talk.

827
01:29:43,561 --> 01:29:44,889
蘇泰！
Tsu'tey!

828
01:29:51,152 --> 01:29:54,022
我是奧馬地卡雅人，跟你們是一起的
I am Omaticaya. I am one of you.

829
01:29:54,864 --> 01:29:57,070
我有發表言論的權利
And I have the right to speak.

830
01:30:01,662 --> 01:30:03,571
我有話要對
I have something to say...

831
01:30:05,957 --> 01:30:07,451
你們所有人說
...to all of you.

832
01:30:11,463 --> 01:30:13,502
這些話猶如巨石壓在我的心頭
The words are like stones in my heart.

833
01:30:17,885 --> 01:30:19,794
長官，對不起，不，不，不！停下！
Sir, I'm sorry. No, no, no! Hold on!

834
01:30:19,929 --> 01:30:22,135
你們不能打攪正在進行的連接進程！
You can't interrupt a link in progress!

835
01:30:23,349 --> 01:30:24,677
這非常危險！
It's very dangerous!

836
01:30:27,311 --> 01:30:28,425
格蕾絲！
Grace!

837
01:30:29,730 --> 01:30:30,844
噢，不
Oh, no.

838
01:30:31,106 --> 01:30:33,063
- 等等！ - 別站起來，先生
- Wait! - Stay down, sir.

839
01:30:34,609 --> 01:30:36,850
好了，聽著…
Okay. Look...

840
01:30:37,946 --> 01:30:39,226
我被派到這裡來…
I was sent here to...

841
01:30:42,909 --> 01:30:44,284
你們看到了嗎？
You see?

842
01:30:44,494 --> 01:30:47,067
它是藏在這個軀殼裡的惡魔
It is a demon in a false body.

843
01:31:06,848 --> 01:31:10,216
- 你瘋了嗎？ - 你越界了
- Are you out of your goddamn mind? - You crossed the line.

844
01:31:13,688 --> 01:31:15,810
把這傢伙帶走
Wheel this meat out of here.

845
01:31:17,608 --> 01:31:20,098
傑克！這裡到底怎麼回事？
Jake! What the hell is going on here?

846
01:31:23,364 --> 01:31:25,107
你讓我失望了，孩子
You let me down, son.

847
01:31:27,159 --> 01:31:28,357
那麼，是怎樣
So, what,

848
01:31:29,911 --> 01:31:31,868
你給自己找了根土著尾巴
you find yourself some local tail

849
01:31:31,997 --> 01:31:35,116
然後就徹底忘了自己的組織？
and you just completely forget what team you're playing for?

850
01:31:35,250 --> 01:31:37,740
帕克，還有時間來挽回現在的形勢
Parker, there is time to salvage the situation.

851
01:31:37,877 --> 01:31:40,332
- 帕克… - 閉上你的臭嘴！
- Parker... - Shut your pie hole!

852
01:31:40,463 --> 01:31:44,626
不然怎樣，瑞克大兵？你要槍斃我嗎？
Or what, Ranger Rick? You gonna shoot me?

853
01:31:44,759 --> 01:31:47,463
- 我可以那麼做 - 你得給你的狗戴上口套
- I could do that. - You need to muzzle your dog.

854
01:31:47,595 --> 01:31:50,299
我們可以冷靜一點嗎？
Yeah, can we just take this down a couple of notches, please?

855
01:31:50,431 --> 01:31:52,838
你說你想讓你的人活著？
You say you want to keep your people alive?

856
01:31:52,975 --> 01:31:54,967
那麼你就該開始聽她的話
You start by listening to her.

857
01:31:55,102 --> 01:31:57,308
那些樹對奧馬地卡雅部落來說很神聖
Those trees were sacred to the Omaticaya

858
01:31:57,437 --> 01:31:59,180
- 超乎你想像的神聖 - 你知道嗎？
- in a way you can't imagine. - You know what?

859
01:31:59,314 --> 01:32:01,555
再這裡隨便扔一根棍子
You throw a stick in the air around here,

860
01:32:01,691 --> 01:32:04,644
都會落在某種神聖的植物上
it's gonna land on some sacred fern,

861
01:32:04,777 --> 01:32:06,057
- 看在上帝的份上！ - 我說的不是
- for Christ's sake! - I'm not talking

862
01:32:06,195 --> 01:32:10,572
某種異教的巫術，我說的是真實存在
about some kind of pagan voodoo here. I'm talking about something real,

863
01:32:10,700 --> 01:32:13,321
在這森林裡可以衡量的東西
something measurable in the biology of the forest.

864
01:32:13,452 --> 01:32:14,862
到底是什麼？
Which is what, exactly?

865
01:32:15,955 --> 01:32:17,235
我們知道的是
What we think we know

866
01:32:17,373 --> 01:32:20,706
這些樹的樹根之間存在某種
is that there is some kind of electrochemical communication

867
01:32:20,834 --> 01:32:25,163
電氣化的通訊，就像神經元的神經鍵一樣
between the roots of the trees, like the synapses between neurons.

868
01:32:25,297 --> 01:32:29,839
每棵樹與周圍的樹的連接 達到10的四次方個
And each tree has ten-to-the-fourth connections to the trees around it.

869
01:32:29,968 --> 01:32:33,134
潘朵拉星球上的樹有10的12次方棵
And there are ten-to-the-twelfth trees on Pandora.

870
01:32:34,055 --> 01:32:36,261
我猜，這數量很大
Which is a lot, I'm guessing.

871
01:32:36,391 --> 01:32:38,716
比人類大腦的連接還要多
It's more connections than the human brain.

872
01:32:39,936 --> 01:32:42,426
懂了嗎？這是個網絡
Get it? It's a network.

873
01:32:42,563 --> 01:32:45,516
是個全星球的網絡，納美人可以登錄上去
It's a global network, and the Na'vi can access it.

874
01:32:45,649 --> 01:32:49,100
他們可以上傳和下載數據，記憶
They can upload and download data. Memories.

875
01:32:49,236 --> 01:32:51,905
就在你們剛毀掉的那些地點
At sites like the one you just destroyed.

876
01:32:52,572 --> 01:32:53,567
對！
Yes!

877
01:32:54,825 --> 01:32:58,904
你們這些人到底吸了什麼毒品了？
What the hell have you people been smoking out there?

878
01:32:59,579 --> 01:33:01,654
他們不過是些該死的樹！
They're just goddamn trees!

879
01:33:03,416 --> 01:33:06,120
- 你得醒醒了，帕克 - 不，你需要醒醒
- You need to wake up, Parker. - No. You need to wake up.

880
01:33:06,252 --> 01:33:10,712
這個世界的財富不在地裡 而是在我們周圍
The wealth of this world isn't in the ground. It's all around us.

881
01:33:10,840 --> 01:33:14,504
納美人知道這個 所以他們在抗爭著保護它
The Na'vi know that, and they are fighting to defend it.

882
01:33:14,635 --> 01:33:18,881
如果你想跟他們分享這個世界 你得理解他們
If you want to share this world with them, you need to understand them.

883
01:33:19,014 --> 01:33:23,640
我說我們很瞭解他們，這得感謝傑克
I'd say we understand them just fine, thanks to Jake here.

884
01:33:25,437 --> 01:33:27,844
嘿，博士，過來看一眼
Hey, Doc, come take a look.

885
01:33:27,981 --> 01:33:30,139
他們不會放棄他們的家園
They're not gonna give up their home.

886
01:33:31,985 --> 01:33:33,609
他們不會達成協議
They're not gonna make a deal.

887
01:33:34,695 --> 01:33:36,936
為的是什麼？低度啤酒嗎？
For what? Lite beer?

888
01:33:37,615 --> 01:33:39,073
藍色牛仔褲嗎？
And blue jeans?

889
01:33:42,369 --> 01:33:45,239
我們有的東西，他們都不需要
There's nothing that we have that they want.

890
01:33:47,165 --> 01:33:50,165
他們讓我出來做的所有事 都是在浪費時間
Everything they sent me out here to do is a waste of time.

891
01:33:55,131 --> 01:33:57,004
他們不會離開家園之樹
They're never gonna leave Hometree.

892
01:33:59,469 --> 01:34:05,423
既然不能達成協議，我想事情就很簡單了
So, since a deal can't be made, I guess things get real simple.

893
01:34:05,641 --> 01:34:10,101
傑克，謝謝，我好感動啊
Jake, thanks. I'm getting all emotional.

894
01:34:10,229 --> 01:34:12,766
我都想跟你來個大濕吻
I might just give you a big wet kiss.

895
01:34:19,821 --> 01:34:23,154
做這事時，我會將土著人傷亡降到最低
I'll do it with minimal casualties to the indigenous.

896
01:34:24,117 --> 01:34:26,572
我先會用毒氣驅趕他們
I'll drive them out with gas first.

897
01:34:27,829 --> 01:34:29,406
會很人道的
It'll be humane.

898
01:34:31,040 --> 01:34:32,450
差不多吧
More or less.

899
01:34:34,210 --> 01:34:36,036
好吧，我們開始行動
All right, let's pull the trigger.

900
01:34:39,673 --> 01:34:41,582
- 大家快點 - 噢，天哪
- Come on, people. - Oh, man.

901
01:34:41,717 --> 01:34:43,376
打好包，準備出發
Let's pack it up, let's go.

902
01:34:43,510 --> 01:34:45,301
就這樣了
This is how it's done.

903
01:34:48,348 --> 01:34:51,633
你想要別人腳下的土地時
When people are sitting on shit that you want,

904
01:34:51,768 --> 01:34:55,765
你把他們變成你的敵人 然後你就能正義地去奪取
you make them your enemy. Then you're justified in taking it.

905
01:34:55,897 --> 01:34:59,312
邁爾斯發動武裝直升機了 他要攻擊家園之樹了
Quaritch is rolling the gunships. He's gonna hit Hometree.

906
01:34:59,442 --> 01:35:00,437
我的天啊
My God.

907
01:35:06,740 --> 01:35:10,903
- 邁爾斯博士！你不能上這裡來！ - 給我走開！
- Dr. Augustine! You cannot be up here! - Back off!

908
01:35:11,036 --> 01:35:14,700
帕克，等一下，別打了 你要攻打的這些人…
Parker. Wait. Stop. These are people you're about to...

909
01:35:14,831 --> 01:35:15,862
- 不，不，不，不，不 - 我說走開！
- No. No, no, no, no. - I said back off!

910
01:35:15,999 --> 01:35:19,367
他們是生活在樹上的招蒼蠅的野人！
They're fly-bitten savages that live in a tree!

911
01:35:19,502 --> 01:35:21,161
好嗎？看看周圍吧！
All right? Look around!

912
01:35:21,296 --> 01:35:24,960
我不知道你看到沒有，可我看到很多樹！ 他們可以搬家！
I don't know about you, but I see a lot of trees! They can move!

913
01:35:25,091 --> 01:35:26,501
- 你們可不可以… - 是，長官
- Can you guys just please... - Yes, sir.

914
01:35:26,634 --> 01:35:29,089
那裡有家庭，有小孩，嬰兒
There are families in there. There are children. Babies.

915
01:35:29,220 --> 01:35:30,464
你要殺害孩子嗎？
Are you gonna kill children?

916
01:35:30,596 --> 01:35:34,463
你不想讓你的雙手沾上那種鮮血，相信我
You don't want that kind of blood on your hands. Believe me.

917
01:35:34,600 --> 01:35:36,925
讓我試著去說服他們吧
Just let me try to talk them out.

918
01:35:37,770 --> 01:35:39,228
他們信任我
They trust me.

919
01:35:42,566 --> 01:35:44,938
趕緊校準，我們要進去了，馬上
Calibrate fast. We're going in, right now.

920
01:35:45,068 --> 01:35:46,941
校準三和四
Calibrating three and four.

921
01:35:47,070 --> 01:35:49,987
- 開始運行 - 啟動，三十秒
- Run sequence. - Initiating. Thirty seconds.

922
01:35:54,410 --> 01:35:56,069
聽著，給你一個小時
Listen to me. You've got one hour.

923
01:35:56,204 --> 01:35:58,741
不然你女朋友還在裡頭的時候 斧頭就會落下來
Unless you want your girlfriend in there when the ax comes down,

924
01:35:58,873 --> 01:36:01,446
你讓他們撤離，一個小時
you get them to evacuate. One hour.

925
01:36:07,381 --> 01:36:08,579
父親！
Father!

926
01:36:08,799 --> 01:36:09,794
母親！
Mother!

927
01:36:09,966 --> 01:36:13,132
艾圖看，我有話要說
Eytukan, I have something to say.

928
01:36:13,303 --> 01:36:14,547
聽他說！
Listen!

929
01:36:15,680 --> 01:36:17,138
說吧，傑克
Speak, Jakesully.

930
01:36:18,516 --> 01:36:21,552
有惡魔要降臨了
A great evil is upon us...

931
01:36:21,936 --> 01:36:23,679
天空人來了
The Sky People are coming...

932
01:36:24,021 --> 01:36:26,428
他們要毀掉家園之樹
...to destroy Hometree.

933
01:36:28,943 --> 01:36:30,318
跟他們說他們很快就要來了
Look, tell them they're gonna be here soon.

934
01:36:32,946 --> 01:36:35,650
你們必須離開，不然會死的
You have to leave, or you're gonna die.

935
01:36:35,782 --> 01:36:37,691
你確定嗎？
Are you certain of this?

936
01:36:41,496 --> 01:36:45,160
他們派我來學習你們的生活方式
Look, they sent me here to learn your ways

937
01:36:46,417 --> 01:36:49,620
有一天我就可以給你們傳遞信息 這樣你們才會相信
so one day I could bring this message and that you would believe it.

938
01:36:52,215 --> 01:36:55,797
傑克，你什麼意思？你知道這事會發生？
What are you saying, Jake? You knew this would happen?

939
01:36:59,054 --> 01:37:00,512
對
Yes.

940
01:37:00,639 --> 01:37:03,011
一開始，我只是聽從命令
Look, at first it was just orders,

941
01:37:04,559 --> 01:37:06,847
可後來事情改變了
and then everything changed.

942
01:37:06,978 --> 01:37:08,721
好嗎？我墜入了情網
Okay? I fell in love.

943
01:37:09,397 --> 01:37:14,639
我愛上了森林，我愛上了奧馬地卡雅人
I fell in love with the forest and with the Omaticaya people.

944
01:37:15,862 --> 01:37:17,272
也愛上了你
And with you.

945
01:37:18,322 --> 01:37:20,113
- 我以前那麼信任你 - 愛上你了，愛上你了
- I trusted you. - With you. With you.

946
01:37:20,241 --> 01:37:23,027
- 我以前那麼信任你！ - 請現在也請信任我
- I trusted you! - Trust me now, please.

947
01:37:30,459 --> 01:37:32,831
你永遠都不會是我們的一員
You will never be one of The People!

948
01:37:32,961 --> 01:37:34,704
- 我不應該… - 我們盡力想制止他們的！
- I shouldn't have... - We tried to stop them!

949
01:37:34,838 --> 01:37:36,795
娜塔瑞，求妳了！求妳了
Neytiri, please! Please.

950
01:37:41,803 --> 01:37:42,834
把他們綁起來
Bind them.

951
01:37:44,639 --> 01:37:45,670
現在就走！
Leave now!

952
01:37:45,848 --> 01:37:49,133
你們必須得走了，他們要來了
You have to go. They're coming!

953
01:38:03,031 --> 01:38:05,189
預定攻擊目標時間，行動
Time on target, one mike.

954
01:38:05,325 --> 01:38:07,234
收到，我們看到了
Copy. We have a visual.

955
01:38:07,369 --> 01:38:10,322
收到，繼續向030進發
Roger that. Stay on heading 030.

956
01:38:10,455 --> 01:38:11,783

957
01:38:25,594 --> 01:38:27,586
- 跑進森林裡！ - 他們來了！

958
01:38:29,264 --> 01:38:33,047
- 他們會毀了整個地方 - 娜塔瑞，妳現在必須離開！
- They will destroy this place. - Neytiri, you must go now!

騎上飛龍…
Take the ikran...

964
01:39:08,968 --> 01:39:10,426
…從上面攻擊
...attack from above.

965
01:39:14,765 --> 01:39:16,887
這真是棵該死的大樹
That is one big damn tree.

966
01:39:24,441 --> 01:39:28,604
瞧，瞧，瞧，我得說外交失敗了
Well, well, well. I'd say diplomacy has failed.

967
01:39:30,614 --> 01:39:32,689
好了，大家，我們把這事了結吧
All right, people, let's get this done!

968
01:39:32,824 --> 01:39:35,610
我要每個毒氣彈都攻入前門
I want every gas round you got right in the front door.

969
01:39:35,743 --> 01:39:37,735
收到，40號彈發射

長官，他們回擊了
Sir, they've opened fire.

973
01:40:04,312 --> 01:40:05,971
你在跟我開玩笑呢吧！
You've got to be kidding me!

974
01:40:18,575 --> 01:40:21,065
這些愚蠢的雜種不懂我們的意思
These dumb bastards ain't getting the message.

975
01:40:21,203 --> 01:40:22,827
好吧，我們來升級戰火吧
All right, let's turn up the heat.

大家都去森林裡
Get everyone to the forest.

980
01:40:49,813 --> 01:40:51,971
驅散蟑螂就是用這個方法
And that's how you scatter the roaches.

981
01:40:55,735 --> 01:40:56,933
娜塔瑞！

我們得離開！他要炸這裡了！
We gotta move! He's gonna blow the columns!

998
01:42:26,863 --> 01:42:28,025
他娘的
Screw this.

嘿，你他媽的在幹嘛？
Hey! What the hell are you doing?

01:42:31,367 --> 01:42:33,110
我當兵不為這個！
I didn't sign up for this shit!

重複，連續發射
Repeat. Ripple fire.

把插頭拔了
Pull the plug.

1020
01:46:55,115 --> 01:46:57,688
- 不，你不可以這麼做 - 你不能這麼做！
- No, you can't do that! - You can't do that!

1021
01:46:57,826 --> 01:46:59,735
- 冷靜！冷靜！ - 不！求你了！
- Calm down! Calm down! - No! Please!

1022
01:47:15,968 --> 01:47:18,505
我是夢想能帶來和平的戰士
I was a warrior who dreamed he could bring peace.

1023
01:47:19,930 --> 01:47:23,797
可是遲早，都會從夢中醒來
Sooner or later, though, you always have to wake up.

1024
01:47:26,645 --> 01:47:28,055
走吧！
Let's go!

1025
01:47:35,945 --> 01:47:37,522
放下他！
Put him down!

1026
01:47:40,908 --> 01:47:43,612
你這個殺人犯！
You murderer!

1027
01:48:30,288 --> 01:48:32,363
兄弟怎麼樣？很久不見了
What's going on, brother? Long time no see.

1028
01:48:32,498 --> 01:48:33,493
嘿
Hey.

1029
01:48:34,917 --> 01:48:37,586
我個人認為這些叛徒們不應該有牛排吃
Personally, I don't feel these tree-hugging traitors deserve steak.

1030
01:48:37,712 --> 01:48:40,997
他們還有牛排吃？真是狗屁，讓我看看
They get steak? That's bullshit. Let me see that.

1031
01:48:42,091 --> 01:48:44,581
對，你知道這是什麼，趴下
Yeah. You know what that is. Down.

1032
01:48:44,718 --> 01:48:47,173
- 楚蒂！ - 趴下去
- Trudy! - All the way down.

1033
01:48:50,640 --> 01:48:51,802
麥克斯！
Max!

1034
01:49:01,901 --> 01:49:04,391
楚蒂，去開直升機！快！
Trudy, fire up the ship! Go!

1035
01:49:04,987 --> 01:49:06,066
給你
Here.

1036
01:49:18,166 --> 01:49:20,573
- 安全，快點 - 給你
- Clear. Come on. - Here you go.

1037
01:49:36,183 --> 01:49:40,050
麥克斯，留在這裡 我需要有我信任的人留在內部
Max, stay here. I need someone on the inside I can trust.

1038
01:49:40,187 --> 01:49:41,385
好的，走
Okay. Go.

1039
01:49:55,243 --> 01:49:56,357
安全
Clear.

1040
01:49:58,371 --> 01:49:59,569
來吧，寶貝
Come on, baby.

1041
01:49:59,705 --> 01:50:02,456
上校？長官？我這裡有情況
Colonel? Sir? I got a situation here.

1042
01:50:06,086 --> 01:50:09,086
薩姆森1-6，未經授權發動飛機
It's Samson 1-6. Unauthorized engine start.

1043
01:50:12,175 --> 01:50:13,419
三！
Three!

1044
01:50:16,304 --> 01:50:17,466
快！
Come on!

1045
01:50:19,516 --> 01:50:20,796
戴上面罩！
Mask on!

1046
01:50:23,394 --> 01:50:25,185
氧氣，氧氣，氧氣！
Gas, gas, gas!

1047
01:50:26,856 --> 01:50:28,848
我被射擊了，快點吧！
I'm taking fire! Let's go!

1048
01:50:31,360 --> 01:50:34,479
抓著我的手，我們上來了，走吧！
Grab my hand! Come on, we're in. Let's go!

1049
01:50:35,489 --> 01:50:37,280
快點，走吧，走吧，走！
Come on, let's go! Let's go, go!

1050
01:50:49,961 --> 01:50:51,241
上校！
Colonel!

1051
01:50:58,052 --> 01:51:01,503
- 好！好！ - 好了！對！
- Yeah! Yeah! - All right! Yes!

1052
01:51:04,767 --> 01:51:07,388
- 完蛋 - 大家都沒事吧？
- Crap. - Everybody all right back there?

1053
01:51:07,519 --> 01:51:08,977
噢，對，寶貝！
Oh, yeah, baby!

1054
01:51:09,104 --> 01:51:10,930
- 諾曼，你還好嗎？ - 對！
- Norm, you good? - Yeah!

1055
01:51:11,857 --> 01:51:14,145
這要毀我一整天了
This is gonna ruin my whole day.

1056
01:51:14,442 --> 01:51:16,185
- 格蕾絲中彈了！ - 什麼？
- Grace is hit! - What?

1057
01:51:17,403 --> 01:51:18,945
- 把急救箱拿過來 - 急救箱！
- Get the trauma kit. - Trauma kit!

1058
01:51:19,072 --> 01:51:22,523
- 繼續壓著，格蕾絲 - 急救箱在前面，在艙壁
- Keep the pressure on, Grace. - Trauma kit's forward, on the bulkhead.

1059
01:51:22,658 --> 01:51:27,070
- 堅持住，格蕾絲 - 不要緊，沒關係的
- Hang on, Grace. - Doesn't matter. It's fine.

1060
01:51:30,457 --> 01:51:32,864
- 可以了 - 升起來
- You're good to go. - Take it up!

1061
01:51:34,086 --> 01:51:35,877
等一下，我在拉
Hold on. I'm pulling pitch.

1062
01:51:40,342 --> 01:51:41,752
安全！
You're clear!

1063
01:51:49,726 --> 01:51:52,430
一直往北飛，帶我們去到深山裡
Just keep going north. Get us deep in the mountains.

1064
01:51:52,562 --> 01:51:53,937
收到
Copy that.

1065
01:52:00,944 --> 01:52:04,229
- 諾曼，你那裡都好嗎？ - 對！還在這裡
- Norm, you all good up there? - Yep! Still here.

1066
01:52:06,116 --> 01:52:10,742
至少，他們追查不到我們的行蹤了 在漩渦深處是偵查不到的
Well, at least they can't track us up here. Not this far into the Vortex.

1067
01:52:10,870 --> 01:52:12,909
在靈魂之樹這裡是漩渦最強的，對吧？
It's strongest at the Tree of Souls, right?

1068
01:52:13,039 --> 01:52:14,449
對
Yeah.

1069
01:52:14,582 --> 01:52:16,491
很好，因為我們就是去那裡
Good. 'Cause that's where we're going.

1070
01:52:25,384 --> 01:52:26,498
哦，疼
Ouch.

1071
01:52:29,972 --> 01:52:31,347
你這個大孩子
You big baby.

1072
01:52:32,724 --> 01:52:34,134
我們去哪裡？
We're moving.

1073
01:52:34,726 --> 01:52:36,765
我會找人幫你，格蕾絲
I'm gonna get you some help, Grace.

1074
01:52:37,729 --> 01:52:39,851
我是個科學家，記得嗎？
I'm a scientist, remember?

1075
01:52:40,815 --> 01:52:43,222
我不相信童話
I don't believe in fairy tales.

1076
01:52:44,110 --> 01:52:45,983
納美人能幫助你
The People can help you.

1077
01:52:46,487 --> 01:52:47,767
我知道的
I know it.

1078
01:52:49,782 --> 01:52:51,608
他們為什麼幫我們？
Why would they help us?

1079
01:53:07,674 --> 01:53:10,758
納美人說伊娃會應驗的
The People say Eywa will provide.

1080
01:53:12,720 --> 01:53:15,389
沒有家，沒有希望
With no home, no hope,

1081
01:53:16,516 --> 01:53:18,638
只有一個地方可以去
there was only one place they could go.

1082
01:53:33,073 --> 01:53:34,235
連接啟動了
Link's running.

1083
01:53:34,991 --> 01:53:37,944
- 我們的計畫是什麼，傑克？ - 沒有計畫
- What's the plan here, Jake? - There's no plan.

1084
01:53:39,037 --> 01:53:43,663
蘇泰現在成為部落領袖了 他不會讓你靠近那個地方的
Tsu'tey is Olo'eyktan now. He's not gonna let you near that place.

1085
01:53:44,709 --> 01:53:46,037
我準備試試看
I gotta try.

1086
01:53:48,838 --> 01:53:50,118
啟動
Launching.

1087
01:54:11,651 --> 01:54:12,849
被驅逐者
Outcast.

1088
01:54:13,653 --> 01:54:14,851
叛徒
Betrayer.

1089
01:54:15,988 --> 01:54:17,102
異己
Alien.

1090
01:54:18,699 --> 01:54:21,368
我在這個地方無立足之地
I was in the place the eye does not see.

1091
01:54:32,587 --> 01:54:36,418
我需要他們的幫助，他們需要我的幫助
I needed their help, and they needed mine.

1092
01:54:37,383 --> 01:54:39,340
可想要再次面對他們
But to ever face them again,

1093
01:54:39,469 --> 01:54:41,876
我需要把自己提高到新的層次
I was gonna have to take it to a whole new level.

1094
01:54:50,479 --> 01:54:53,764
有時候一個瘋狂的舉動能扭轉乾坤
Sometimes your whole life boils down to one insane move.

1095
01:54:56,568 --> 01:54:58,893
我們得做一些事
There's something we gotta do.

1096
01:54:59,029 --> 01:55:00,688
你不會喜歡的事
You're not gonna like it.

1097
01:55:10,748 --> 01:55:14,531
我是這樣想的，圖靈鳥在天上所向披靡
The way I had it figured, Toruk is the baddest cat in the sky.

1098
01:55:14,668 --> 01:55:16,245
從來沒有被攻擊過
Nothing attacks him.

1099
01:55:16,795 --> 01:55:18,075
慢慢的，孩子
Easy, boy.

1100
01:55:18,589 --> 01:55:20,380
那麼他為什麼還要往上看呢？
So why would he ever look up?

1101
01:55:21,550 --> 01:55:23,127
當然，這只是一個想法
But that was just a theory.

1102
01:56:33,868 --> 01:56:35,445
圖靈鳥騎士？
Toruk Macto?

1103
01:57:15,282 --> 01:57:16,740
我看到你了
I See you.

1104
01:57:19,869 --> 01:57:21,149
我看到你了
I See you.

1105
01:57:29,503 --> 01:57:31,162
我很恐懼，傑克
I was afraid, Jake.

1106
01:57:32,631 --> 01:57:34,089
為我的人民而恐懼
For my people.

1107
01:57:37,177 --> 01:57:38,754
現在我不恐懼了
I'm not anymore.

1108
01:57:48,271 --> 01:57:50,512
蘇泰，埃特尤之子
Tsu'tey, son of Ateyo...

1109
01:57:51,274 --> 01:57:53,147
我站在你的面前
...I stand before you...

1110
01:57:54,277 --> 01:57:57,313
準備為奧馬地卡雅人民效力
...ready to serve the Omaticaya people.

1111
01:57:59,991 --> 01:58:04,202
你是領袖，你是偉大的戰士
You are Olo'eyktan, and you are a great warrior.

1112
01:58:05,412 --> 01:58:07,534
沒有你，我無法成事
I can't do this without you.

1113
01:58:14,629 --> 01:58:16,004
圖靈騎士
Toruk Macto,

1114
01:58:23,888 --> 01:58:25,595
我要和你一起飛翔
I will fly with you.

1115
01:58:28,934 --> 01:58:30,641
我的朋友要死了
My friend is dying.

1116
01:58:33,063 --> 01:58:34,557
格蕾絲要死了
Grace is dying.

1117
01:58:36,608 --> 01:58:38,434
我祈求伊娃的幫助
I beg the help of Eywa.

1118
01:58:50,371 --> 01:58:52,328
看看我們在哪裡，格蕾絲
Look where we are, Grace.

1119
01:58:59,088 --> 01:59:01,413
我得取一些標本
I need to take some samples.

1120
01:59:24,904 --> 01:59:28,948
聖母將選擇拯救
The Great Mother may choose to save all that she is

1121
01:59:30,200 --> 01:59:31,610
這具軀體
in this body.

1122
01:59:34,204 --> 01:59:35,828
這有可能嗎？
Is that possible?

1123
01:59:35,956 --> 01:59:40,416
她必須經過伊娃的治療，然後回來
She must pass through the eye of Eywa and return.

1124
01:59:41,711 --> 01:59:43,205
可，傑克
But, Jakesully,

1125
01:59:44,255 --> 01:59:45,832
她非常虛弱
she is very weak.

1126
01:59:47,341 --> 01:59:50,127
堅持住，格蕾絲，他們會治好你的
Hang on, Grace. They're gonna fix you up.

1127
01:59:53,431 --> 01:59:55,968
請傾聽我們，聖母
Hear us please, All Mother.

1128
01:59:56,600 --> 01:59:58,806
伊娃，救她吧
Eywa, help her.

1129
01:59:59,603 --> 02:00:01,725
把這個靈魂帶走
Take this spirit into you...

1130
02:00:05,400 --> 02:00:07,475
救活她，讓她回到我們的身邊
...and breathe her back to us.

1131
02:00:11,406 --> 02:00:12,983
讓她跟我們一起行走
Let her walk among us...

1132
02:00:15,576 --> 02:00:17,449
作為納美人的一份子
...as one of The People.

1133
02:00:46,397 --> 02:00:47,428
傑克
Jake.

1134
02:00:49,900 --> 02:00:51,014
格蕾絲
Grace.

1135
02:00:53,195 --> 02:00:54,854
我和她在一起，傑克
I'm with her, Jake.

1136
02:00:56,907 --> 02:00:58,235
她是真的！
She's real!

1137
02:01:01,328 --> 02:01:04,447
格蕾絲？格蕾絲，格蕾絲！
Grace? Grace, please. Grace!

1138
02:01:05,665 --> 02:01:07,242
怎麼了？
What's happening?

1139
02:01:08,251 --> 02:01:09,875
怎麼了？
What's happening?

1140
02:01:14,257 --> 02:01:15,371
格蕾絲！
Grace!

1141
02:01:16,133 --> 02:01:17,247
格蕾絲！
Grace!

1142
02:01:19,386 --> 02:01:20,963
怎麼了？
What's happening?

1143
02:01:27,269 --> 02:01:28,644
起作用了嗎？
Did it work?

1144
02:01:34,359 --> 02:01:38,403
她傷得太嚴重了，時間來不及了
Her wounds were too great. It was not enough time.

1145
02:01:40,114 --> 02:01:41,821
她現在跟伊娃在一起了
She is with Eywa now.

1146
02:02:15,648 --> 02:02:18,269
請允許我說話
With your permission, I will speak now.

1147
02:02:20,694 --> 02:02:23,101
希望能榮幸地請你幫我做翻譯
You would honor me by translating.

1148
02:02:30,245 --> 02:02:32,403
天空人給我們一個信息
The Sky People have sent us a message

1149
02:02:35,833 --> 02:02:38,205
他們能拿走他們想要的一切
that they can take whatever they want

1150
02:02:40,046 --> 02:02:41,789
沒人可以阻止他們
and no one can stop them.

1151
02:02:45,426 --> 02:02:47,169
我們要帶給他們一個信息
Well, we will send them a message.

1152
02:02:49,847 --> 02:02:52,135
風有多快，你們就能飛多快
You ride out as fast as the wind can carry you.

1153
02:02:55,477 --> 02:02:57,802
你讓其他部族的人來
You tell the other clans to come.

1154
02:03:00,982 --> 02:03:03,437
你告訴他們圖靈騎士向他們發出邀請
You tell them Toruk Macto calls to them.

1155
02:03:05,695 --> 02:03:08,446
現在你們跟著我一起飛！
And you fly now with me!

1156
02:03:09,532 --> 02:03:11,987
我的兄弟們！姐妹們！
My brothers! Sisters!

1157
02:03:13,118 --> 02:03:15,157
我們要給天空人看看
And we will show the Sky People

1158
02:03:16,205 --> 02:03:18,031
他們不能拿走他們想要的一切
that they cannot take whatever they want,

1159
02:03:19,583 --> 02:03:20,993
這裡
and that this,

1160
02:03:21,752 --> 02:03:22,747
這裡是我們的土地！
this is our land!

1161
02:03:29,884 --> 02:03:31,294
呀！
Yah!

1162
02:03:46,441 --> 02:03:47,816
呀！
Yah!

1163
02:04:17,262 --> 02:04:18,590
呀！
Yah!

1164
02:04:36,155 --> 02:04:37,613
我們去到四風
We rode out to the four winds.

1165
02:04:40,409 --> 02:04:42,781
去到平原馬上部族
To the horse clans of the plain.

1166
02:04:45,789 --> 02:04:46,784
回到星球上去！
Back to the stars!

1167
02:04:46,915 --> 02:04:49,073
去到東海的伊克蘭部落
To the ikran people of the Eastern Sea.

1168
02:04:49,209 --> 02:04:50,407
為了我們孩子的孩子
For our children's children!

1169
02:04:50,543 --> 02:04:53,080
當圖靈騎士號召時，他們一呼百應
When Toruk Macto called them, they came.

1170
02:04:56,966 --> 02:04:58,294
呀！
Yah!

1171
02:05:34,501 --> 02:05:36,956
基地裡的所有人，你們所有人
Everyone on this base, every one of you,

1172
02:05:37,087 --> 02:05:38,878
都在為生存而戰
is fighting for survival.

1173
02:05:39,006 --> 02:05:40,464
這是事實！
That's a fact!

1174
02:05:41,341 --> 02:05:45,041
外面的土著部落正集結準備攻擊我們
There's an aboriginal horde out there massing for an attack.

1175
02:05:46,179 --> 02:05:50,010
現在，這些軌道圖像告訴我
Now, these orbital images tell me

1176
02:05:50,475 --> 02:05:53,641
敵人的數量在一天之內
that the hostiles' numbers have gone from a few hundred

1177
02:05:53,770 --> 02:05:56,260
從幾百變成了兩千多
to well over 2,000 in one day.

1178
02:05:56,856 --> 02:05:58,813
人數還在增多
And more are pouring in.

1179
02:06:01,318 --> 02:06:04,686
一週內，將會有兩萬人
In a week's time, there could be 20,000 of them.

1180
02:06:04,822 --> 02:06:07,110
這樣的話，他們將會突破我們的防線
At that point, they will overrun our perimeter.

1181
02:06:07,241 --> 02:06:09,399
這是不會發生的！
Well, that's not gonna happen!

1182
02:06:11,036 --> 02:06:14,618
只有先發制人的進攻才能確保我們的安全
Our only security lies in pre-emptive attack.

1183
02:06:14,748 --> 02:06:17,073
我們將以暴制暴
We will fight terror with terror.

1184
02:06:21,421 --> 02:06:25,548
現在敵人們相信他們的高山大本營
Now, the hostiles believe that this mountain stronghold of theirs

1185
02:06:25,675 --> 02:06:28,000
是受到保護的
is protected by their...

1186
02:06:28,135 --> 02:06:29,463
受到他們的女神的保護
Their deity.

1187
02:06:30,804 --> 02:06:32,843
我們摧毀他們的大本營
And when we destroy it,

1188
02:06:32,973 --> 02:06:35,261
會給他們的種族記憶帶來嚴重的打擊
we will blast a crater in their racial memory so deep

1189
02:06:35,392 --> 02:06:38,843
他們再也不敢靠近這方圓1000公里的地方
that they won't come within 1,000 klicks of this place ever again.

1190
02:06:38,979 --> 02:06:41,648
而這個，也是個事實
And that, too, is a fact.

1191
02:06:42,399 --> 02:06:44,106
好！好
Yeah! Yeah.

1192
02:06:54,618 --> 02:06:58,532
傑克，這裡已經瘋了，全體總動員 他們把飛船裝備成轟炸機了
Jake, it's crazy here. It's full mobilization. They're rigging the shuttle as a bomber.

1193
02:06:58,664 --> 02:07:00,870
他們裝備了巨型的礦山炸藥
They've got these huge pallets of mine explosives.

1194
02:07:00,999 --> 02:07:03,869
用於某種震懾行動
It's for some kind of shock-and-awe campaign.

1195
02:07:04,002 --> 02:07:05,875
全是該死的大殺傷性炸彈
Fricking daisy cutters!

1196
02:07:07,422 --> 02:07:10,208
邁爾斯已經全面接手，主持大局 無可阻擋
Quaritch has taken over. He's rolling, and there's no stopping him.

1197
02:07:10,342 --> 02:07:12,381
- 什麼時候？ - 明早六點
- When? - 0600 tomorrow.

1198
02:07:12,510 --> 02:07:14,336
- 麥克斯！麥克斯！ - 我得走了
- Max! Max! - I gotta go.

1199
02:07:16,264 --> 02:07:17,722
我們完蛋了
We're screwed!

1200
02:07:19,225 --> 02:07:21,383
我還希望能有一些不包括殉難在內的
And I was hoping for some sort of tactical plan

1201
02:07:21,519 --> 02:07:23,677
戰略計畫
that didn't involve martyrdom.

1202
02:07:25,189 --> 02:07:28,522
我們要用弓箭對付武裝直升飛機
We're going up against gunships with bows and arrows.

1203
02:07:31,570 --> 02:07:33,562
我在外面有15個部落種族的人
I have 15 clans out there.

1204
02:07:34,281 --> 02:07:36,356
有2000多個戰士
That's over 2,000 warriors.

1205
02:07:37,909 --> 02:07:42,321
現在，我們瞭解這些山 我們能飛過去，你能飛過去，他們不能
Now, we know these mountains. We fly them. You fly them. They don't.

1206
02:07:43,414 --> 02:07:47,411
他們的設備在這裡行不通 導彈追蹤沒有用
Their instruments won't work up here. Missile tracking won't work.

1207
02:07:47,960 --> 02:07:49,418
他們得有視野才能開火
They'll have to fire a line of sight.

1208
02:07:49,545 --> 02:07:53,756
如果他們挑起戰爭 那麼我們就有主場優勢
If they bring the fight to us, then we have the home-field advantage.

1209
02:07:55,676 --> 02:07:59,091
你知道他會直接把炸彈投到靈魂之樹
You know he's gonna commit that bomber straight to the Tree of Souls.

1210
02:07:59,221 --> 02:08:00,383
對，我知道
Yeah, I know.

1211
02:08:00,514 --> 02:08:02,969
如果他們炸掉靈魂之樹，就完了
If they get to the Tree of Souls, it's over.

1212
02:08:03,100 --> 02:08:06,266
那可是他們與祖先伊娃的直接聯繫
That's their direct line to Eywa, their ancestors.

1213
02:08:07,103 --> 02:08:09,060
這會摧毀他們的
It'll destroy them.

1214
02:08:09,189 --> 02:08:11,561
那我想我們最好阻止他
Then I guess we'd better stop him.

1215
02:08:26,663 --> 02:08:29,616
現在我可能只是對著一棵樹說話
I'm probably just talking to a tree right now.

1216
02:08:32,085 --> 02:08:36,793
可如果你在那裡，我要給你提個醒
But if you're there, I need to give you a heads-up.

1217
02:08:39,384 --> 02:08:43,761
如果格蕾絲跟你在一起，搜尋她的記憶
If Grace is with you, look into her memories.

1218
02:08:45,056 --> 02:08:47,131
看看我們來自的世界
See the world we come from.

1219
02:08:48,267 --> 02:08:50,140
那裡沒有綠色
There's no green there.

1220
02:08:51,562 --> 02:08:53,519
他們殺了他們的母親
They killed their Mother.

1221
02:08:54,356 --> 02:08:56,811
在這裡他們也會做同樣的事
And they're gonna do the same here.

1222
02:08:58,485 --> 02:09:01,022
更多的天空人會到來
More Sky People are gonna come.

1223
02:09:01,154 --> 02:09:04,154
就像永遠下不完的雨一樣，一直都有人來
They're gonna come like a rain that never ends.

1224
02:09:05,492 --> 02:09:07,199
除非我們阻止他們
Unless we stop them.

1225
02:09:09,829 --> 02:09:12,865
你選擇了我
Look, you chose me for something.

1226
02:09:14,375 --> 02:09:16,201
我會挺身而出，參加戰鬥
I will stand and fight.

1227
02:09:17,294 --> 02:09:18,836
你知道我會的
You know I will.

1228
02:09:21,382 --> 02:09:23,588
可是我需要一點幫助
But I need a little help here.

1229
02:09:29,764 --> 02:09:32,764
我們的聖母不會幫助任何一邊，傑克
Our Great Mother does not take sides, Jake.

1230
02:09:34,602 --> 02:09:38,017
她只保護生命的平衡
She protects only the balance of life.

1231
02:09:49,867 --> 02:09:51,526
這值得一試
It was worth a try.

1232
02:10:22,272 --> 02:10:24,229
對！對！就是這樣！
Yeah! Yeah! That's what I'm talking about!

1233
02:10:24,357 --> 02:10:27,642
對！對！就是這樣！
Yeah! Yeah! That's what I'm talking about, man!

1234
02:10:39,789 --> 02:10:43,122
我是小組領導，我們在進入漩渦
This is Group Leader. We are entering the Flux Vortex.

我想讓這個任務速戰速決 我想回家吃晚飯
I want this mission high and tight. I want to be home for dinner.

1238

- 重裝小組，出發 - 好了，女士們，給他們點苦果嘗嘗吧
- Suit Team, go. - All right, ladies, let's bring the pain!

1239

1246
02:12:17,047 --> 02:12:20,332
全體都有，爸爸帶頭，向目標前進
All call signs, Papa has lead, pushing to target.

1247
02:12:20,467 --> 02:12:22,839
護航機，跟緊我的飛船
Escorts, stay close on my shuttle.

1248
02:12:27,974 --> 02:12:30,464
太近了，漆都快被刮掉了
We are gonna lose some paint in here.

1249
02:12:31,477 --> 02:12:34,050
槍手們，注意眼觀八方
Gun crews, keep your head on a swivel.

1250
02:12:34,230 --> 02:12:37,100
不要犯錯，我們就在那裡

長官！所有護航機都墜毀了或掉隊了
Sir! All escorts are down or falling back.

我們來解決這事，瓦爾基莉1-6，我是龍
Let's get this done. Valkyrie 1-6, this is Dragon.

02:22:30,874 --> 02:22:33,708
- 準備射擊目標 - 收到，準備射擊目標

一切都結束了

只要我還呼吸，就都還沒結束

我還挺希望你這麼說的
I kind of hoped you'd say that.

快點！
Come on!

1329
02:28:42,349 --> 02:28:46,393
嘿，傑克，背叛自己的種族是什麼感覺？
Hey, Sully, how's it feel to betray your own race?

1330
02:28:51,107 --> 02:28:53,229
你覺得你是他們中的一份子？
You think you're one of them?

02:28:54,527 --> 02:28:56,104
該醒醒了
Time to wake up.

1332

02:31:14,242 --> 02:31:15,570
傑克
Jake.

1335

他們不再需要圖靈騎士

因為不管今晚發生什麼，我…

1344
02:33:25,448 --> 02:33:28,234
我都不會回到這個地方

我想我最好走了
